# **Why You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)**  

For the longest time, I thought I was just *tired.*  

Not enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time. Classic exhaustion, right?  

So I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.  

But no matter what I did, the fatigue **never went away.**  

I blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, *"This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired."*  

Then I realized something.  

I wasn’t just **physically** exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.  

And no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.  

Because **we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.**

## **The 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them)**  

### **1. Mental Exhaustion** (*The Overloaded Brain*)  
Too many tabs open (in your browser *and* your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.  
- **Symptoms:** Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination.  

### **2. Emotional Exhaustion** (*The Feeling Drain*)  
When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.  
- **Symptoms:** Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap.  

### **3. Creative Exhaustion** (*The Empty Tank*)  
The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in 'output mode' for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.  
- **Symptoms:** Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking.  

### **4. Social Exhaustion** (*The People Drain*)  
It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.  
- **Symptoms:** Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings.  

### **5. Sensory Exhaustion** (*The Overstimulation Overload*)  
Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it **never shuts up.**  
- **Symptoms:** Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness.

## **Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest)**  

Here’s the problem: **we treat them all the same way.**  

- **Mental exhaustion?** We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive.  
- **Emotional exhaustion?** We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them.  
- **Creative exhaustion?** We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it.  
- **Social exhaustion?** We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue.  
- **Sensory exhaustion?** We "relax" by staring at another screen.  

We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.  

But if you don’t know *what kind* of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.

## **So Here’s How I’m Fixing It**  

Instead of "resting" in a generic way, I’m **resting with purpose.**  

I match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.  

---

### **1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset**  

- **Deep work in short bursts** – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching.  
- **Digital decluttering** – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling.  
- **Brain dump journaling** – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space.  

---

### **2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue**  

- **Fewer choices** – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to.  
- **Emotional boundaries** – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions.  
- **Journaling** – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up.  

---

### **3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration**  

- **Consume good input** – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things.  
- **Change of scenery** – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective.  
- **Play** – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids.  

---

### **4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude**  

- **Meaningful connections only** – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk.  
- **Scheduled alone time** – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions.  
- **Boundaries** – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel.  

---

### **5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise**  

- **Digital detox** – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode.  
- **Minimalist workspace** – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload.  
- **Silence and darkness** – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses.

## **The Takeaway**  

We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about *not sleeping enough.*  

But the real question isn’t **"Am I tired?"**—it’s **"What kind of tired am I?"**  

Once you figure that out?  
You can finally start **recharging the right way.**  

And you might just find that you’re not broken.  
You were just **resting wrong.**
