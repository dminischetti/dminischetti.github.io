I used to think I was just *tired.* Not enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time. Classic exhaustion, right?

I’d chug coffee, get a few more hours of sleep when I could, and push through the day.  
But the fatigue never went away.  

I blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I thought, *“This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.”*  

But then I started paying attention. I wasn’t just physically drained—I was mentally overloaded, emotionally stretched thin, and creatively empty. And no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.

That’s when it hit me: **we don’t just have one type of energy.**  
And we don’t just get tired in one way.

## **The 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them)**

1. **Mental Exhaustion** – The classic burnout. Too many tabs open (in your brain *and* your browser), constant context-switching, information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were even supposed to do.  
   - *Symptoms:* Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination.  

2. **Emotional Exhaustion** – When your feelings are on overdrive. Decision fatigue, social pressure, worrying about *everything*. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.  
   - *Symptoms:* Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap.  

3. **Creative Exhaustion** – The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in ‘output mode’ for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is... nothing.  
   - *Symptoms:* Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking.  

4. **Social Exhaustion** – The people drain. It’s not about introvert vs. extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even texting back feels like a chore.  
   - *Symptoms:* Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings.  

5. **Sensory Exhaustion** – The one nobody talks about. Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.  
   - *Symptoms:* Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness.

## **Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest)**

Here’s the worst part: **we treat them all the same way.**  

- **Mental exhaustion?** We take a break—but then scroll through social media, which keeps our brain buzzing.  
- **Emotional exhaustion?** We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them.  
- **Creative exhaustion?** We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix the problem.  
- **Social exhaustion?** We go to more social events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue.  
- **Sensory exhaustion?** We relax by staring at more screens.  

We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.  
But if you don’t know *what kind* of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.  

I learned this the hard way. I tried to rest in all the “normal” ways and still felt drained.  
That’s when I realized: **rest isn’t one-size-fits-all.**

## **So Here’s How I’m Fixing It**

Instead of just "resting" in a generic way, I’m **resting with purpose.**  
I started matching the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I was feeling. And it changed everything.  

---

### **1. Mental Exhaustion**  

- **What it feels like:** Brain fog, inability to focus, decision fatigue.  
- **How I fix it:**  
  - **Deep work in short bursts.** I work in focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching.  
  - **Digital decluttering.** Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, and no mindless scrolling.  
  - **Mind dumping.** I write down every stray thought to clear mental space.  

---

### **2. Emotional Exhaustion**  

- **What it feels like:** Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or emotionally drained.  
- **How I fix it:**  
  - **Fewer decisions.** I pre-plan small choices (like meals and outfits) to reduce decision fatigue.  
  - **Emotional boundaries.** I say ‘no’ more often and limit emotionally draining interactions.  
  - **Journaling.** I process emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up.  

---

### **3. Creative Exhaustion**  

- **What it feels like:** No new ideas, stuck in repetitive thinking, uninspired.  
- **How I fix it:**  
  - **Consume good input.** I read books, watch inspiring videos, and experience new things to refill my creative well.  
  - **Change of scenery.** I go for a walk, visit a new place, or simply switch rooms to reset my perspective.  
  - **Play.** I do something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids.  

---

### **4. Social Exhaustion**  

- **What it feels like:** Feeling drained after social interactions, avoiding messages or calls.  
- **How I fix it:**  
  - **Intentional connection.** I prioritize meaningful interactions and skip superficial small talk.  
  - **Scheduled solitude.** I intentionally plan alone time to recharge without interruptions.  
  - **Boundaries.** I limit social commitments and give myself permission to cancel when needed.  

---

### **5. Sensory Exhaustion**  

- **What it feels like:** Overstimulated by noise, lights, screens, or crowded spaces.  
- **How I fix it:**  
  - **Digital detox.** No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode.  
  - **Minimalist workspace.** I reduce visual clutter to minimize sensory overload.  
  - **Silence and darkness.** I spend time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses.

## **The Takeaway**

We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about *not sleeping enough.*  
But the real question isn’t **"Am I tired?"**—it’s **"What kind of tired am I?"**  

Once you figure out what kind of tired you are?  
You can finally start **recharging the right way.**  

And you might just find that you’re not broken.  
You were just **resting wrong.**
