There’s this idea that changing your mind is a sign of weakness. That once you take a stance on something, you have to defend it forever. That **certainty equals strength** and doubt means you don’t know what you’re doing.

I completely disagree.

I change my mind **all the time.** And not because I’m indecisive—but because **I’m evolving.**

## **The Art of the Self-Debate**

It’s easy to believe your opinion is the right one. I mean, why wouldn’t it be? Your brain worked hard to form it. It makes sense. It feels correct.

And then, a few moments later… a strange thing happens.

You start thinking about the **opposite perspective.** You question your own logic. You realize, *wait, maybe I was missing something.*

Some people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed, defensive, or even ashamed. But I see it differently: **every time I change my mind, I get closer to being right.**

I’ve realized that my opinions are just **snapshots** of my understanding at that moment. And just like outdated software, opinions need updates.

I constantly ask myself:  
- *What if I’m wrong?*  
- *What am I not considering?*  
- *How would someone who disagrees with me see this?*  

I play devil’s advocate with myself. I argue against my own ideas, poke holes in my logic, and challenge my own beliefs. 

This isn’t me being wishy-washy. This is me **debugging my own thinking.**  

And every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I update my mental software. I evolve.

## **Married Life: The Ultimate Debate Club**

If you ever need practice in changing your mind, get married. 

My wife and I **love** to debate. Not argue—debate. Our conversations start with small things:

- *Is this really the best way to load the dishwasher?*  
- *Is a hotdog a sandwich?*  
- *Should we rearrange the furniture… again?*  

But soon, we’re deep into bigger questions about life, philosophy, and everything in between. Our ideas clash, we both present our cases, and sometimes, **we completely switch sides.**

Two hours later? **We’re both better people than we were at the start of the conversation.**  

Because it’s not about winning. It’s about **learning.** It’s about seeing the world through someone else’s eyes. It’s about testing your own ideas and seeing if they hold up.

And sometimes, they don’t. Sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit that I was wrong. 

(Okay, **often** she’s right, but that’s another story.)

But every time I admit I’m wrong, **I get smarter.**  

And every time she admits she’s wrong, **we both grow stronger.**

## **Why Changing Your Mind is a Superpower**

Here’s what I’ve learned:

- If you never change your mind, you’re not learning—**you’re just repeating yourself.**  
- Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak—**it makes you someone worth listening to.**  
- The smartest people aren’t the ones who defend their ideas at all costs—**they’re the ones who refine their ideas constantly.**  

Think about it: every time you change your mind, it means **you’ve updated your thinking.** You’ve gathered new information, considered a new angle, and sharpened your perspective.

- **Science** changes its mind all the time. That’s how it progresses.  
- **Great leaders** adapt to new information instead of stubbornly clinging to outdated beliefs.  
- **Successful people** don’t see changing their mind as failure—they see it as growth.  

Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before. It means you’re smarter now.

It doesn’t mean you were wrong. It means you’ve **learned something new.**  

And over time? **Your mind gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles truth.**

## **Version 2.0 (And Beyond)**

I used to think changing my mind meant I was inconsistent or unreliable. Now, I see it as a sign of growth.  

I’m constantly debugging my beliefs. I’m constantly updating my worldview. I’m constantly learning.

Some people are proud of how consistent they are. But if you’re consistent for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.

People who never change their minds? They’re just stuck in version 1.0 of themselves.  
But the people who question, rethink, and adapt? **They’re constantly evolving.** Constantly improving.  

I don’t want to be version 1.0 forever. I want to be **version 2.0, 3.0, 10.0,** and beyond. I want to grow, adapt, and keep learning.

And that means being willing to say, *“I was wrong.”*  
It means being willing to change my mind, even when it’s uncomfortable.  
It means embracing doubt, questioning certainty, and seeing every debate as a chance to **upgrade.**

## **The Takeaway**

People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what. But real strength?  
**Real strength is about knowing when to change your mind.**  

It’s about being curious enough to question your own beliefs.  
Humble enough to admit when you’re wrong.  
Smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.  

So next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.  
Take it as a **sign that you’re upgrading.**  

Because the strongest minds aren’t the ones that never change.  
They’re the ones that **never stop evolving.**
