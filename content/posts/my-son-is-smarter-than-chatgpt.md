## My Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT

I thought I was smart. I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.

And slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:  
This tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.

---

### He Tasted the World — Literally

Babies have **30,000 taste buds**. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s **three times** more than adults.

When my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if *you* could taste shapes, or feel sounds.

Some researchers believe that babies might experience **synesthesia** early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally **taste textures** or **feel sounds** before those brain connections settle down.

Honestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.

---

### He Saw Things I’ll Never See Again

At one point, my son could recognize **every human face** — no matter the ethnicity. Even *monkeys*. Yes, monkeys.

But then came **perceptual narrowing**: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, *“We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”*

Now he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.

For a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.

And we call adults smart?

---

### He Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up

At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked **vision and touch**.

This is called **peripersonal space awareness**, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.

By eight months, babies **expect sensory outcomes** — and are *surprised* when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.  
That’s **if-then logic**, built in.

And unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.

---

### He Could Hear Every Language on Earth

Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones *we don’t even speak*.

Hindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.

But as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.

This is called **phonetic narrowing**. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.

Meanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.

---

### His Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t.

There’s this old myth that babies lose the **stepping reflex** by 2 months. Not true.

What actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.

In fact, one study showed that babies who "lost" the stepping reflex started doing it again… *in water*, where their legs were lighter.

So yes — my son had the **walking software pre-installed**, he was just waiting for the **driver update**.

---

### He Knows If You're a Good Person

Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.

They even **prefer nice puppets** over mean ones. Without being told.

That’s **proto-moral reasoning**. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.

If my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.

---

### He Does Math. The Impossible Kind.

If you show a baby a simple math "trick" — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.

That’s because they know something’s off.  
It’s called **number sense**.

No formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.  
It’s basically **unit testing for logic** — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.

---

### Babbling = Precompiled Language

When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.

He’s compiling syntax.

Studies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will **babble with their hands**. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.

So language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about **brains**. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.

He’s not learning language. He’s already running the **beta release**.

---

### His Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids

Here’s what’s running during nap time:

- Neural pruning
- REM-driven memory consolidation
- Cortisol modulation
- Synaptic reorganization
- Night mode updates

Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.  
It’s **unsupervised machine learning**, every night.

Which is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.

## Final Thoughts

Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.

But none of it — **none of it** — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.

He’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.

He’s not just smart.

He’s **smarter than ChatGPT**.

And when I ask him something…  
He looks me in the eye…

…and says: *"Banana."*

Which, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.
