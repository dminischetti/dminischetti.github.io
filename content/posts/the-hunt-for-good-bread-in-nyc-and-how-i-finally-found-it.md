# The Hunt for Good Bread in NYC (And How I Finally Found It)

You ever bite into a slice of bread and think, *This is it. This is the one*? Because for the longest time, I didn’t.  

Moving to New York, I figured finding good bread would be easy. I mean, it’s NYC! Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps. But Italian-style bread? That was a different story.  

### **Too Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless?**  

The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:  

1. **Too soft**—like, *pillow* soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.  
2. **Too sweet**—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has a weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.  
3. **Too tasteless**—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite... nothing. Just air and disappointment.  

And don’t even get me started on the prices. Artisan bakeries? Amazing, but unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.  

### **A Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer)**  

Enter: **My Wife, The Genius.**  

Last Christmas, B *(my wife)* surprised me with a bread machine. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting it. I’d casually complained how expensive good bread was *(let's say "casually")*, how nothing tasted quite *right*, and how I wished I could just make my own. I guess she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom!—bread machine under the tree.  

(I love you, B ❤️)  

Now, I’d love to say my first loaf came out perfect. That I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created a masterpiece. But let’s be real—it was a disaster. Dense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency (*Intruder? Bam—bread to the head*).  

Turns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.  

### **Bread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba)**  

In Italy, we don’t really have a specific “bread flour” sitting on supermarket shelves. Instead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure. Simple, right? Well, try finding Manitoba flour in New York. I dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.  

Eventually, I cracked the code: **Just buy bread flour.** Problem solved.  

But then I had another discovery—one that changed everything: **semolina.**  

### **Semolina: The Secret Weapon**  

The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing. Suddenly, the crust had that *snap*, the inside had more flavor, and the whole loaf just felt... right. Not easy to find, but totally worth the effort.  

And that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements. I love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better. Maybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows?  

### **Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda.**  

Now, let’s talk cost. Making bread at home isn’t free. Good flour isn’t cheap, and yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).  

But is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? *Nope.*  
Is it way better than supermarket bread? *Absolutely.*  
Does it take more than four minutes of effort? *Not really.*  

Four minutes to throw ingredients in, press a button, and then just wait. That’s it. No kneading, no babysitting dough, just a little patience.  

And the best part? My house smells like a bakery every time.  

### **The Never-Ending Bread Journey**  

So here I am, an Italian guy in NYC, still tweaking, still learning, but finally—**finally**—happy with my bread. And if I ever move again (hey, it’s happened before), at least I know one thing: 

**Good bread isn’t something you find. It’s something you make.**
