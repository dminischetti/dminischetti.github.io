There was a time when Facebook and Instagram felt like **a lifeline**—a way to stay connected with my friends, to see their lives, share mine, and keep some sort of bridge between us.  

Then, at some point, Mark Zuckerberg apparently decided my nostalgia needed to be monetized. These days, my Facebook feed is basically this:

- **Ad**
- **Ad**
- Friend at the beach in Puglia (ouch, thanks for reminding me)
- **Ad**
- Friend eating fresh mozzarella (now you're just hurting my feelings)
- **Ad**
- Guy trying to sell me crypto

Meanwhile, I’m in New York, staring at a "fresh" mozzarella ball that has the texture of a wet sponge.

At some point, I had to ask myself: **Why am I still here?**  

Leaving wasn’t a sudden decision. There was no dramatic moment of *“That’s it, I’M DONE!”* 

At first, I just posted less. Then I stopped checking notifications. Eventually, my accounts became **digital storage units**—a place where old photos sat collecting virtual dust.  

And the strangest part? **No one even noticed.**  

The people who actually matter in my life? **They already have my number.** They text, call, WhatsApp me. They don’t need to "like" a photo to know I care about them.  

So again... **why am I still here?**  

Remember when social media was about *your* friends? Now it’s just:  

- **Daniel San**, telling me "Things I didn't know before 30." (Listen, Daniel, I'm 46. At this point I'm forgetting things I knew perfectly well at 30. It's called aging gracefully.)
- **Khaby Lame**, silently mocking viral idiots who complicate basic tasks. (Actually, Khaby's pretty funny, but how many potato-peeling hacks do we really need?)
- **Jay Shetty**, soothingly explaining how deadlines aren't important, only inner peace matters. (Jay, maybe tell my landlord that next month.)

Meanwhile, my actual friends? **Their posts are buried under 15 ads for things Alexa heard me casually saying.**  

And when I do finally see them? It’s just another picture of them at a seaside restaurant eating fresh pasta, while I’m here in New York with a *manicotti dish that tastes like cardboard sadness.*  

So, it's time to say basta. I'm logging out, not just "taking a break." I'm deleting my accounts, completely and permanently.  

But don't worry—I'm not disappearing into thin air (though occasionally I wish I could). If you're someone who actually wants to stay in touch, you already know how to reach me:

📞 **Call me.** Yes, phones still work for talking.  
💬 **Text or WhatsApp me.** I might take a while to reply, but I always do.  
✉️ **Email me.** I’m old enough to still like emails.  

Basically, if you’re someone who actually wants to stay in touch, **you already know how to find me.**  

And if you don’t? Maybe we were just social media acquaintances, and that’s okay too.  

So, that’s it. No dramatic goodbye, no *soul-searching journey*. Just **logging out and moving on**.  

See you on the other side. 😊
