Most people collect things. I eliminate them.

I’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale **mission to find the absolute best**—the **one** perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.

One **backpack.** One **pen.** One **pencil.** One **bathroom set.** Everything I own must be **the best, the most compact, the most portable.**

Why? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently. **Not as objects, but as decisions.**

I don’t want five backpacks—I want *one* that does it all.  
I don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want *one* that feels perfect in my hand.  
I don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want *one* streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.

This isn’t just minimalism. It’s **ruthless optimization.**

## **The Rules of the Game**

Finding **The One** is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about **functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.**

1. **Compactness is king.** If it’s too bulky, it’s out. I need **portability without sacrifice.**
2. **One item, zero regrets.** Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. **This is my Excalibur.**
3. **Quality over everything.** If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. I’m not rebuying a “meh” item in six months.
4. **No over-engineered nonsense.** If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I don’t want it. Keep it simple, keep it smart.

This isn’t about being cheap. It’s about investing in **the best, once.** And then never thinking about it again.

## **The Search is Brutal**

You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.

Finding the **one** perfect item in any category means sifting through **a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right** options.

- The best **backpack**? Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats.
- The best **pen**? Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream *pretentious fountain pen guy*. Found it. But wait—should I test one more?
- The best **toothbrush**? Yes, even **this** is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. Why is this so hard?

Each decision is a battle. A **war between function and obsession.**

And the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt. 

- *“This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”*  
- *“This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”*  
- *“This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”*  

I fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make spreadsheets with pros and cons. I look at measurements, weights, materials, and durability tests. 

Yes, I’m that person.

## **Why I Love This Insanity**

Some people call it overthinking. I call it **engineering my life for efficiency.**

Because once I’ve chosen The One, I’m free. No more switching. No more rebuying. No more second-guessing.

Just **one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.**

It’s about reducing **decision fatigue.** It’s about knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me. It’s about **portability, mobility, and adaptability.**

It’s also about being prepared. I’ve moved across continents multiple times. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the freedom of traveling light and the nightmare of clutter. 

So when the next big move happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready. No clutter. No baggage. Just **the best, most compact version of everything I need.**

## **The Final Boss Battle of Minimalism**

I’m not naive. I know **The One** doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out. But the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.

It’s about **curating my life** to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about **choosing quality over quantity** in every decision.

So if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.

And when I finally find The One? 

I’ll stop looking.  
Until the next perfect version comes out.
