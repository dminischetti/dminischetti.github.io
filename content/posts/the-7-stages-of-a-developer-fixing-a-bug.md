If you’ve ever worked as a developer, you know that fixing a bug is never just *fixing a bug*. It’s an emotional rollercoaster, a psychological test, and sometimes, a personal attack on your own intelligence.

It always follows the same pattern.

---

## **1. Confidence** (*"This will be easy."*)

You open the ticket, read the description, and think, *Oh, I see what’s happening. I’ll knock this out in 10 minutes.*

Maybe you even tell your boss or a teammate: *“I’ll have a fix pushed soon.”*

(A fatal mistake.)

I’ve done this too many times. Every. Single. Time. I convince myself that it’s just a quick fix. I even schedule my next coffee break around it. It’s like walking into a trap that you built yourself… but you keep doing it anyway.

---

## **2. Confusion** (*"Wait. What?"*)

You try the obvious fix. It doesn’t work.

You start looking at the logs. The logs don’t make sense.

You check the database. The database values *should* be correct.

You stare at the code like it personally betrayed you. 

You read the same line of code for the tenth time, convinced you’re missing something. You start questioning your sanity. *This should work. Why doesn’t it work?*

Welcome to the rabbit hole.

---

## **3. Denial** (*"This bug shouldn’t even be possible."*)

You reach the phase where you begin **questioning reality itself.**

- *This code has been running fine for years. Why is it breaking now?*
- *It works in local but not in production. What dark magic is this?*
- *Did I introduce this bug? No… no, it can’t be me. Right? RIGHT?*

At this point, I usually start suspecting cosmic interference. Mercury must be in retrograde. Maybe the server just hates me. Or maybe... just maybe... the compiler is broken?

It’s clearly not my fault. It can’t be.

---

## **4. Bargaining** (*"What if I just... add some debug logs?"*)

At this point, you’re lost. You start throwing in `var_dump()`, `console.log()`, and debug prints like a desperate person tossing coins into a wishing well.

I’ve been known to add so many logs that my console starts to look like the Matrix. I convince myself that more logs will lead to more understanding. It never does.

Nothing makes sense. You add more logs. You commit to a full-on print statement religion.

The logs only make things *worse.*

---

## **5. Anger** (*"WHO WROTE THIS CODE?!"*)

You check `git blame`. You see a name.

It’s your name.

…Oh.

This is the stage where I briefly contemplate quitting tech and becoming a goat farmer. Maybe life would be simpler if I just spent my days herding goats. Goats don’t have bugs.

---

## **6. Acceptance** (*"Fine. I’ll actually debug this properly."*)

You take a deep breath. You go back to the fundamentals. Step through the code. Check every assumption. Slowly, painfully, you start to *understand*.

You realize you were overcomplicating things. You stop treating it like a personal attack and start treating it like a problem to solve.

And then, after hours (or days)…

You find it.

The bug.

Some missing condition. A logic error. A typo. Something so small yet so catastrophic that you briefly consider quitting tech altogether.

I’ve found bugs caused by a single misplaced semicolon. I’ve lost hours to a variable name that was one character off. And I’ve questioned my entire career choice because of a `<=` that should have been `<`.

---

## **7. Victory (and Regret)** (*"Fixed! …Oh no."*)

You push the fix. You celebrate. You feel like a god.

Then you look at the time and realize: **you spent 6 hours fixing a one-line bug.**

You close the ticket. You move on. You tell yourself it won’t happen again.

But deep down, you know the truth.

It *always* happens again.

Because this is the life we chose. This is what we signed up for. The endless cycle of **confidence**, **confusion**, **denial**, **bargaining**, **anger**, **acceptance**, and **regret**. 

And honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way.
