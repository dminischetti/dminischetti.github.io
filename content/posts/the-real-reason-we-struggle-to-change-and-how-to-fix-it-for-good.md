I used to think change was about willpower.

If I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to **try harder**. Push through the resistance. Be disciplined.

I told myself, *“Just do it. No excuses.”* And for a while, it would work. I’d get up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.

But then, inevitably, I’d slip. I’d skip one workout, procrastinate on one project, or hit snooze one too many times. 

And every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt *broken*. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.

Then I learned something that changed everything:  
**We don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.**

## **Why "Trying Harder" Never Works**

Think about this: two people are offered a cigarette.

- The first person says, *“No thanks, I’m trying to quit.”*  
- The second person says, *“No thanks, I don’t smoke.”*  

See the difference? The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.

The first person is using willpower. They’re actively resisting a craving. It’s a battle, and battles are exhausting.  

The second person isn’t fighting anything. Their identity has shifted—they simply don’t see themselves as a smoker anymore.

That’s why most habits fail. We focus on *doing* instead of *becoming*.  
We try to change our actions without changing our identity.

## **The Identity-Based Approach to Lasting Change**

Instead of relying on willpower, I’ve started shifting my identity first.

I realized that every action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become. If I consistently show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I consistently write, I’m becoming a writer. 

But it works the other way too. If I skip workouts, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who doesn’t prioritize fitness. If I procrastinate, I’m becoming someone who avoids challenges.

I had to stop seeing habits as things I *do* and start seeing them as things that define *who I am.*

## **How I’m Hacking My Brain to Change for Good**

I started with simple identity shifts:  

- Instead of *“I should exercise more,”* I tell myself *“I’m the kind of person who moves every day.”*  
- Instead of *“I need to focus better,”* I remind myself *“I’m someone who works with deep focus.”*  
- Instead of *“I need to stop procrastinating,”* I say *“I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.”*  

At first, it feels fake. I felt like an imposter saying things that didn’t feel true yet. But here’s the secret: **your brain hates cognitive dissonance.**  

When you tell yourself you *are* something, you subconsciously start acting like it. Your brain wants to align your actions with your identity.

- If I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels weird to sit on the couch all day.  
- If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels wrong to keep checking my phone every five minutes.  
- If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character.  

It’s not about forcing yourself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like **who you are.**

## **The Difference Between Trying and Being**

I used to say:  
- *“I’m trying to exercise more.”*  
- *“I’m trying to focus better.”*  
- *“I’m trying to wake up earlier.”*  

But now I say:  
- *“I’m a person who moves every day.”*  
- *“I’m someone who works with focus.”*  
- *“I’m the kind of person who gets up early.”*  

See the difference? The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.  

And identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes the way you see yourself, and the way you see yourself changes your actions.

## **The Takeaway**

Willpower is unreliable. Motivation fades. But identity? Identity sticks.

If you want to change something, don’t start with *what* you do.  
Start with *who* you are.

- Want to read more? Become a reader.  
- Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health.  
- Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it.  

Because the truth is, **we don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.**  

Change who you are, and the actions will follow.
