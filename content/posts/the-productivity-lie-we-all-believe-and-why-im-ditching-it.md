For years, I thought I had cracked the code to getting things done. I was a multitasker, a master of spinning plates. Answering messages while debugging code, cooking dinner while listening to a tech podcast, planning my week while pushing a stroller. I was convinced that this was peak efficiency.

Turns out, I was dead wrong.

Here’s the harsh truth: multitasking is a scam. And worse? It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.

## **The Hidden Cost of Doing It All**

We live in a world that worships the ability to juggle. Job descriptions praise it. Productivity gurus preach it. If you’re not multitasking, you’re falling behind, right?

But science—and my own experience—beg to differ. Multitasking isn’t actually doing two things at once. It’s rapid task-switching, and every switch comes with a mental price tag. I wasn’t being more productive; I was just fragmenting my focus into tiny, inefficient pieces.

I started realizing that every time I jumped between writing code and answering Slack messages, I wasn’t doubling my output—I was introducing micro-delays that made everything take longer. Every time I checked my phone while spending time with my family, I wasn’t present—I was just mentally buffering between two worlds, never fully in either.

I used to think that multitasking was the secret weapon that kept me ahead. But it was actually the very thing keeping me stuck. I was always busy but never truly productive.

And then I read something that hit me like a brick: **The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.**

## **So Here’s What I’m Doing Instead**

I’ve started embracing **single-tasking** like my productivity depends on it—because it does.

- **Time-blocking 2.0** – I used to time-block my day down to the minute, which only made me stressed when things didn’t go as planned. Now, instead of rigid schedules, I’m aligning tasks with my actual energy levels. High-focus work when my brain is sharp, low-focus tasks when I’m running on fumes. It’s all about working with my brain, not against it.
- **Digital decluttering** – I used to think a million open tabs meant I was working hard. It didn’t. It just meant I was distracted. Now I close them, write down what I actually need, and handle it *one thing at a time.* If something’s important, it goes on my Notion board. If it’s not, it’s gone.
- **The “one-tab rule”** – If my brain needs a second tab, it means I need a second task slot *later,* not *now.* This one was tough to learn because as a developer, I’m used to juggling documentation, Stack Overflow threads, and my IDE. But once I stopped, I realized my focus got sharper.
- **Thinking in depth, not breadth** – Instead of half-absorbing five articles, I read one properly and actually retain something. No more fake productivity. No more information overload.

The result? My focus is deeper. My stress is lower. My work is better. And best of all—I’m *actually* present in my own life.

I’m no longer mentally jumping between 10 different things. I’m just doing one. And I’m doing it well.

## **The Takeaway**

We’ve been sold the lie that multitasking is the key to success. But what if the real key is the opposite?

Imagine a world where we stopped bragging about how busy we are and started taking pride in *how well we do one thing at a time.* Imagine how different our work, relationships, and even our mental health would feel.

I’m not perfect at it yet. I catch myself falling back into old habits, trying to check messages while pushing code, wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call. But now, I notice it. I stop. I refocus.

I’m done with the chaos.
