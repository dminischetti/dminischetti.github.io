## **My Brain: A High-Speed Action Movie with No Pause Button**

My brain is like an over-engineered action movie. There’s **no pause button, no clear plot**, and just when you think we’re getting somewhere, BAM—**hard cut to a completely unrelated subplot.**

One second, I’m working. Deep focus. Absolute flow. The kind of state productivity gurus dream about.  
The next second? Oh, look, a fascinating article about how ancient Romans made concrete.  
Wait, wasn’t I supposed to answer that email?  
Oh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let’s do some research.  
Wait. **What was I doing?**

And just like that, I’ve time-traveled 30 minutes into the future, holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of a completely different task than the one I started.

## **The Productivity Toolbox: Every Method Ever Invented**

I’ve tried everything. **Every. Single. System.**

- **Post-it Notes?** Great, until my desk looks like a crime investigation board.
- **Timers?** Perfect, until I focus so hard that I forget I set them.
- **To-do lists?** Love them. Make them daily. Never look at them again.
- **Apps?** Oh, I **collect** productivity apps like Pokémon. I have at least five for tasks, two for time tracking, one for notes, and none of them actually help if I forget to open them.
- **Pomodoro?** Sure, except when I ignore the break and work for four hours straight because my brain suddenly decided *this is the most important task in the universe*.

I’ve tried all the classic productivity advice:
- *“Just prioritize better!”* Sure, but they’re all priorities.  
- *“Why not use reminders?”* Great idea. If only I remembered to set them.  
- *“Have you tried digital planners?”* Yes. I lost track of them, too.

It’s not that I don’t try. It’s that my brain doesn’t always cooperate.

And yet… I still get things done.

## **How I Actually Make It Work**

Despite the chaos, I’ve found ways to work *with* my brain instead of fighting against it. Not through *one perfect system* (because that doesn’t exist), but through **a constantly shifting mix of tricks, hacks, and Jedi mind games.**

- **Single-tasking like a rebel.** Multitasking? I gave that up. If I try doing two things at once, I’ll end up doing neither. Now, it’s *one* task at a time, with a mental guard dog barking at distractions.
- **Externalizing everything.** My memory? Unreliable. My second brain? Post-its, Notion, alarms, and a series of carefully placed **"HEY, DON'T FORGET THIS"** notes that future me will either appreciate or resent.
- **The Two-Minute Rule.** If it takes less than two minutes, I do it immediately. Because if I don’t, it disappears into the void of “I’ll get to it later” (translation: it’s never happening).
- **Timers, but with extra supervision.** I set a timer *and* a backup timer. And sometimes, I ask someone to remind me that I even set a timer.
- **Letting deep focus work for me.** If my brain decides something is **THE TASK**, I ride that wave for as long as it lasts. No questions asked.

But most importantly?

### **I Work With My Brain, Not Against It**

I stopped trying to fit my workflow into productivity systems that weren’t built for the way I think. I realized that I can’t force focus, but I can **capture it** when it shows up.

If I’m locked in on a task, I run with it—even if it wasn’t what I planned for the day. If my mind is bouncing between ten ideas, I capture them on paper, messy and unordered, and sort them out later.

I’ve accepted that my productivity isn’t linear. It’s more like a zig-zagging roller coaster. And that’s okay.

## **The Tools That (Sometimes) Work**

- **Notion:** My digital brain dump. It’s chaotic, but everything goes there. If I forget where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion.
- **Post-it Notes:** Old-school but reliable. They’re everywhere. My desk, my monitor, my wallet. I leave notes to future me like breadcrumbs through a maze.
- **Timers (Multiple):** I have timers on my phone, my watch, and my laptop. I need all three because I will absolutely forget one of them is ticking.
- **Single-tasking Mode:** One tab. One window. One task. If I need a second tab, it means I need a second task slot *later,* not now.
- **Solid Starts:** Yes, even for feeding my son. Because guess what? Focus struggles don’t take a break just because you’re a parent.

## **The Takeaway**

Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have **a small museum of abandoned productivity tools**.

But at the end of the day? I always **get things done.** It might not be linear, it might not be conventional, but it works.

Because sometimes, thinking differently is the secret ingredient to finding solutions no one else sees.

So if you ever see me staring into space, just know: I’m either solving a complex problem… or I just momentarily forgot what I was doing. Either way, I’ll figure it out.
