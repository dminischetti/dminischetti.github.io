I’ve never been a beard guy.

For most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just *happened* to other people—like an automatic feature they activated once they reached a certain age. I’d see guys with thick, full beards and think, *Yeah, that’s just not for me.*

It wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself: **I shave because I always have.**

But then, for the first time, I didn’t.

## **The Accidental Beard Experiment**

It wasn’t planned. I didn’t wake up one morning and declare, *I shall grow a beard!*

It started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy, I got lazy, and before I knew it, there was more stubble than usual. Normally, this would have annoyed me. But this time?

I let it stay.

At first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me. I kept catching glimpses of myself and thinking, *Who is this guy?* The itchy phase was real. The “patchy, awkward” phase? Even more real. But the strangest part?

I kind of liked it.

I started noticing little things, like the way it made me look older or the way it changed the shape of my face. I’d catch myself stroking my chin while thinking, like some kind of wise philosopher (or just a guy getting used to having hair there).

And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. It was just… different. A reminder that my face was changing, even if just a little bit.

## **Why Growing a Beard Felt So… Different**

It’s funny how something as simple as **not shaving** can change the way you see yourself.

- **I looked different.** Obvious, but still surprising. My face felt more defined, my jawline stronger. It was like adding a filter to my face—only this one was real.
- **I felt different.** There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more *deliberate.* Like I had made a decision, even if it was just to keep the beard a little longer.
- **Other people noticed.** “Oh, you’re growing it out?” “Hey, that actually suits you.” “You look… more Italian now.” (That one made me laugh.) 

I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, but all I did was… not shave. 

I got a few “that’s different” looks, but mostly positive reactions. And every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.

## **What I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing**

I’m not saying growing a beard is some kind of life-changing event. It’s hair. On my face. That’s it.

But what *was* surprising? The realization that so many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults,” the things we *always* do—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.

For years, I thought:  
✔ *I’m a clean-shaven guy.*  
✔ *Beards don’t suit me.*  
✔ *This is just how I look.*

And then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.

It made me think: how many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way? 

- **I’m not a morning person.** (Or am I just used to staying up late?)
- **I don’t like public speaking.** (Or have I just never given it a real chance?)
- **I’m not a beard guy.** (Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?)

It’s strange how something as simple as **not shaving** can make you question so much more.

## **Will I Keep It?**

I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll shave it off next week. Maybe I’ll decide I like it and keep it. 

Right now, I’m just letting it do its thing. No expectations. No rules. Just curiosity.

But either way, it’s not really about the beard.

It’s about realizing that sometimes, **the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.**

And honestly? That’s worth exploring.
