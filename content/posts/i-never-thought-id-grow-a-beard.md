I’ve never been a **beard guy.**  

For most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just **happened** to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age. I’d see guys with **thick, full beards** and think, *Yeah, that’s just not for me.*  

It wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:  

✔ **I shave because I always have.**  
✔ **I’m just not a beard person.**  

And then, one day... **I didn’t shave.**

## **The Accidental Beard Experiment**  

I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, *I shall grow a beard!*  

It started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had **more stubble than usual.**  

Normally, this would have **annoyed me.** But this time?  

I let it stay.  

At first, it felt weird—like my **own face was betraying me.** I'd catch glimpses of myself and think, *Who is this guy?*  

The **itchy phase** was real.  
The **awkward patchy phase** was even more real.  

But the strangest part?  

I **kind of liked it.**  

I started noticing little things:  
- It made me **look older** (or maybe just *different*).  
- It **changed the shape of my face.**  
- I kept catching myself **stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher.**  

And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a **reminder** that something was changing.

## **Why Growing a Beard Felt So… Different**  

It’s funny how something as simple as **not shaving** can change the way you see yourself.  

- **I looked different.** My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a **real-life Instagram filter.**  
- **I felt different.** There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more **deliberate.** Like I had *made a choice*, even if that choice was just to... not shave.  
- **Other people noticed.**  
  - *"Oh, you’re growing it out?"*  
  - *"Hey, that actually suits you."*  
  - *"You look… more Italian now."* (*That one made me laugh.*)  

I wasn’t prepared for how much **other people** would comment on it. It was like I had **changed something huge**, when all I did was... *nothing.*  

And every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of **pride and discomfort.** Like I was being **seen in a new way**—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.

## **What I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing**  

Growing a beard **didn’t change my life.**  

But it did make me **realize something important.**  

So many of the things we believe about ourselves—our **“defaults”**—aren’t actually rules. They’re just **habits.**  

For years, I thought:  
✔ *I’m a clean-shaven guy.*  
✔ *Beards don’t suit me.*  
✔ *This is just how I look.*  

And then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” **disappeared.**  

It made me wonder:  
*How many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?*  

- **I’m not a morning person.** (*Or am I just used to staying up late?*)  
- **I don’t like public speaking.** (*Or have I just never given it a real chance?*)  
- **I’m not a beard guy.** (*Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?*)  

It’s strange how something as simple as **not shaving** can make you question so much more.

## **Will I Keep It?**  

I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll **shave it off next week.**  
Maybe I’ll **keep it longer.**  

Right now, I’m just **letting it be.**  

No expectations. No rules. Just **curiosity.**  

But either way, this isn’t really about the beard.  

It’s about realizing that sometimes, **the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.**  

And honestly? **That’s worth exploring.**
