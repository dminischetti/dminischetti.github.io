*Forgive me if I’m writing this as a poem. - I don’t really know how else to say these things.*

Sometimes I see the task.  
**Clear. Small. Right there.**  
But I don’t move.  
Not because I don’t want to—  
because something invisible holds me still.

When I do start,  
it’s like a hidden engine kicks in.  
I don’t warm up.  
**I just go.**  
*Fast. Focused. A running train.*  
Almost like I was always moving—  
just stuck inside.

I take in too much.  
Every sound. Every flicker.  
A butterfly near the window can steal a whole hour.  
A voice from across the street can live in my head all day.  
Even **silence** isn’t silent—  
it has *its own shape*,  
*its own pressure.*  
I don’t get to ignore the world.  
**I feel all of it. All the time.**

Even myself.  
Sometimes there is static in my head,  
sometimes my inner self won’t stop talking.  
*Bla bla bla...*

And if a thought comes, I have to speak it.  
Right away.  
Or it’s gone.  
**Completely.**  
And no one around me knows  
I just lost something I was proud of.

I forget birthdays,  
deadlines,  
my own ideas.  
I lose my thoughts like my keys.

But I remember a tree from when I was six.  
A **weeping willow** in old town.  
Not just its smell—  
but *the way the air felt*,  
*how time moved slower under it*,  
*how safe everything was*  
before I even knew the word **“safe.”**

I build perfect systems in my head.  
Then I change them.  
Not because they fail—  
because my brain stops seeing them once they become familiar.

I look for **one perfect thing** for each need:  
one backpack, one pencil, one bar of soap.  
Not to be picky.  
To protect myself  
from choice,  
from overwhelm,  
from *losing time I can’t afford to lose.*

I love with action, not noise.  
You may not hear me say it,  
but I’ll hand you your charger before you ask.  
I’ll remember your favorite cookie,  
walk beside you in silence,  
bring the umbrella without a word.

My partner thinks in **spirals**.  
Moves fast,  
talks fast,  
lives in ideas that come all at once.

I move slowly.  
Quietly.  
But I finish what she can’t.  
She starts what I avoid.

We are *not the same storm.*  
But somehow,  
we turn **the same sky.**

I forget.  
But I always return.  
Every day is a reset.  
Not because I failed yesterday—  
but because I’m still here today.

Still trying.  
**Still becoming.**  
Still remembering  
*the scent of the willow*  
when things were still and soft  
and the world didn’t expect me to be so sharp all the time.

***Forgive me if I said something strange.***  
*I still think in Italian,*  
*even when I write in English.*
