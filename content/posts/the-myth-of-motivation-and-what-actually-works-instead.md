For years, I waited for motivation to strike.

I thought productive people *felt* like doing things. That they had some magical drive I didn’t. That one day, I’d wake up, feel inspired, and finally become the person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects without procrastinating.

Guess what? That day never came.

And it never *will.*

Because here’s the truth: **Motivation is a lie.**

## **Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter**

We’ve all said it:

- *“I just need to get motivated.”*  
- *“I’ll start when I feel ready.”*  
- *“I don’t have the energy today.”*  

But motivation isn’t something you *have.* It’s something you *create.*

We think action comes *after* motivation—when really, it’s the other way around. **Motivation follows action, not the other way around.**

You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.  
You start, and then inspiration finds you.

The moment I realized this, everything changed.

I used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation. I’d imagine myself full of energy, ready to tackle all my tasks with passion and enthusiasm. But that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.

Then I noticed something:  
**I always felt more motivated after I started, not before.**  
It didn’t matter how small the start was. If I could just get myself to begin, momentum took over.

That’s when I realized: **Motivation is a side effect of action.**

## **What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple)**

If I waited to *feel* motivated, I’d never do anything. So instead, I use **three simple rules** that make action inevitable:

---

### **1. The 5-Minute Rule**

If something feels overwhelming, I tell myself I’ll just do it for five minutes. Just five. That’s it.

- Too tired to work out? **Five minutes of exercise.**  
- Don’t want to start that project? **Five minutes of brainstorming.**  
- Can’t focus on writing? **Five minutes of bad first drafts.**  

**90% of the time, I keep going.** Because starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.

And if I really do stop after five minutes?  
At least I did something. And something is infinitely better than nothing.

### **2. The “No Emotion” Rule**

I stopped asking myself if I *felt* like doing something. Feelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.

So I stopped negotiating with myself. I stopped the internal debates about whether I was “in the mood” or whether it was the “right time.”

Now, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. **No debates. No negotiations.** It’s just what I do.

- **Exercise?** It’s not about feeling motivated. It’s just “time to move.”  
- **Writing?** It’s not about feeling inspired. It’s just “time to write.”  
- **Starting work?** It’s not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”  

**Action first, feelings later.** 

Surprisingly, once I start, the motivation usually shows up. But if it doesn’t? **Who cares?** I’m already doing the thing.

### **3. The 3-Choice Trick**

When I don’t want to do something, I give myself three options:

1. **Do it now.** (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)  
2. **Do it badly.** (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)  
3. **Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.**  

Turns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.

This trick works because it eliminates other distractions. I’m not allowed to scroll on my phone, check social media, or do anything else.  
My only choices are: **work, do it badly, or stare at a wall.** 

And honestly? Working or doing it badly is better than the existential void of wall-staring.

## **Why This Works: The Science of Momentum**

Newton’s First Law of Motion states:  
**“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.”**  

Turns out, this applies to humans too.

When we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving. But once we start, it’s easier to keep going.

This is why the hardest part of any task is **getting started.** It’s why the 5-minute rule works so well. It breaks the inertia.

And once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.  

It’s not about willpower. It’s about **tricking your brain into motion.**

## **The Takeaway**

Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you.

If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever. If you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.

But action? Action leads to momentum. And momentum creates motivation.

So next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.

- **Start for five minutes.** (Even if it’s terrible.)  
- **Do it without debating.** (Feelings can catch up later.)  
- **Give yourself only three choices.** (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)  

Because once you start, you *won’t* stop.  
And when you stop needing motivation to begin, **you’ll get more done than ever before.**
