👋 **Hi, I’m Dominic**

I write code that works. (And when it breaks, it does so with the flair of a *drama queen* 👑.) I also break systems just enough so I can fix them better.

By day, I’m a *PHP backend engineer* 💻, navigating the wild tech world from my remote desk in *Brooklyn* 🗽. I make sure things don’t implode—and even my bugs come with a **complimentary fix** (or so I tell my boss 😅).

When night falls, I switch gears to become a dad armed with **“Dad Logic”** (spoiler: it never works 🤷‍♂️) and a husband on a mission to dazzle my wife with my ever-growing collection of tech toys 🎮.

My life isn’t as straightforward as a neat line of code. Born in *New York* 🗽, raised in *Italy* 🇮🇹, and now back in the city that never sleeps, I’ve mastered the art of being a *wandering soul*.

My journey from *Italy* 🇮🇹 to *New York* 🗽 (and back again… and then back once more) isn’t just a change of scenery—it’s about *chasing opportunities*, *embracing uncertainty* 🤞, and perfecting the art of *gesticulating* 🤌 while debating if New York bagels can ever really compete with Italian bread (spoiler: they can’t, but they come pretty darn close 🍞).

I didn’t follow the usual path. After nearly a decade wrestling with a *computer science degree* 🎓 that just didn’t fit my brain, I emerged as a developer who thinks differently—always looking beyond the obvious for the *unexpected* 🔍. This mindset helps me build systems that (mostly) don’t crash and fix bugs that everyone else avoids.

When I’m not coding, I’m off navigating life as a husband and dad. I’m married to my *anchor* (and my toughest—and always *right*—critic, sorry not sorry 😅). We’re raising two amazing kids: one whose *curiosity* keeps me asking questions 🤔, and another who makes sure I never get a full night’s sleep 😴.

I call *Brooklyn* 🗽 home sometimes, but I carry *Italy* 🇮🇹 in my heart—especially when it comes to a love for *good food* 🍝 and a refusal to settle for anything less than *perfection* ✨. My life is a blend of *Italian soul* and *New York grit*, proving that sometimes, *breaking the mold* builds something even better.

If any of this resonates—or if you believe that *digital minimalism* is just a fancy excuse to splurge on gadgets—drop me a line at **dominic.minischetti@gmail.com**.

But fair warning: I’m *stubborn* about Italian bread 🍞.
