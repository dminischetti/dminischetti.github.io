# **👋 Hi, I’m Dominic**  

I write code that works. *(Most of the time.)* And when it breaks, it does so with the **dramatic flair of a telenovela character**. I also break things on purpose—because the best way to fix something is to *first see how it falls apart.*  

By day, I’m a **PHP backend engineer**, making sure systems don’t implode (or at least fail gracefully). I work remotely from **Brooklyn** 🗽, where my bugs come with **complimentary fixes**—or at least a very convincing explanation.  

By night, I trade in debugging for **Dad Logic™** (which, let’s be honest, never works 🤷‍♂️) and a never-ending quest to impress my wife with the **tech gadgets she never asked for**.

## **🌍 A Life Between Two Worlds**  

Born in **New York**, raised in **Italy**, and now back in the city that never sleeps, my life has been a series of loops—like a recursive function that just won’t quit.  

I didn’t follow a straight path. After spending **nearly a decade wrestling with a computer science degree** that refused to cooperate, I built my own way forward. Instead of perfect grades, I gained a **problem-solving mindset** that helps me tackle challenges from unexpected angles.  

And while my Italian roots run deep (especially when it comes to **good food** 🍝), my New York grit means I refuse to settle for anything less than **perfection**.

## **💻 What I Do**  

I love **building, fixing, and optimizing**—whether it’s backend systems, workflows, or my workspace setup that I will *never stop tweaking.*  

My work revolves around:  
✔ **PHP Development** – Making things work behind the scenes.  
✔ **Problem-Solving** – Debugging what others avoid.  
✔ **System Optimization** – Streamlining, automating, improving.  

But beyond coding, I’m always **learning, exploring, and experimenting**—from **digital minimalism** (a great excuse to buy better gadgets) to **productivity hacks** (that I sometimes ignore).

## **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Life Outside Code**  

When I’m not deep in terminal commands, I’m:  
- **Being a dad** – Raising two amazing kids: one who questions everything 🤔, and one who ensures I never sleep.  
- **Being a husband** – To my *anchor*, my toughest critic, and the person who is *always right* (just ask her).  
- **Debating bread superiority** – *New York bagels? Excellent. But let’s not pretend they beat real Italian bread.* 🍞
