## **👋 Hi, I'm Dominic**

I write code that works. (And when it breaks, it does so with the flair of a drama queen.) I also break systems just enough to fix them better.

I’m a PHP backend engineer, currently navigating the wild world of tech from my remote desk in Brooklyn. By day, I’m the guy who makes sure systems don’t implode, and even my bugs come with a complimentary fix. (Or at least that’s what I tell my boss. 😅) By night, I’m a dad attempting to outsmart my kids with “Dad Logic” (spoiler: it never works) and a husband trying to impress my wife with my never-ending collection of tech toys.

But my story isn’t as straightforward as a clean line of code. Born in New York, raised in Italy, and now back in the city that never sleeps, I’ve mastered the art of being a wandering soul.

My journey from Italy to New York (and back again… and then back once more) isn’t just about geography. It’s about chasing opportunities, embracing uncertainty, and mastering the art of gesticulating while debating whether New York bagels can ever truly compete with Italian bread (spoiler: they can’t, but they come close).

I didn’t follow the usual path. I spent nearly a decade wrestling with a computer science degree that didn’t fit how my brain works. But that struggle shaped me into a developer who thinks differently—who looks beyond the obvious and finds solutions in the unexpected. I bring that same mindset to my work, where I build systems that (mostly) don’t crash and fix bugs no one else wants to touch.

When I’m not coding, I’m navigating life as a husband and dad. I’m married to my anchor and my biggest critic—who’s always right (and I hate that). We’re raising two incredible kids: one whose curiosity reminds me to keep asking questions, and the other who ensures I never get a full night’s sleep.

I live in Brooklyn but carry Italy with me—especially in my unapologetic love for good food and my refusal to accept anything less than perfection. My life is a blend of Italian soul and New York grit, and my work is proof that breaking the mold can build something better.

This site is where my professional journey meets my personal chaos. Check out my [**Resume**](/resume) to see how I’ve turned mistakes into milestones. Or visit my [**Blog**](/blog) for my take on tech, life, and the constant quest for balance.

***But fair warning:*** I’m stubborn about Italian bread.
