**Welcome to my digital sandbox** – a place where technology, work, and life come together. Here, I share my experience as a developer, my thoughts on tech, and bits of my personal journey. Expect a mix of coding, problem-solving, and everyday adventures.

*(Why "sandbox"? In programming, a sandbox is a safe space to test ideas. This site is my own sandbox—where I experiment, learn, and have fun! My daughter even drew a sandbox for me as a logo. ❤️)*
