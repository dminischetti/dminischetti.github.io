**👋 Hi, I'm Dominic**

**I write code that works.** (And when it breaks, it does so with the flair of a *drama queen* 👑.) I also break systems just enough to fix them better 🔧.

I’m a *PHP backend engineer* 💻, currently navigating the wild world of tech from my remote desk in *Brooklyn* 🗽. By day, I’m the guy who makes sure systems don’t implode, and even my *bugs* 🐞 come with a **complimentary fix**. (Or at least that’s what I tell my boss. 😅) By night, I’m a dad attempting to outsmart my kids with **“Dad Logic”** (*spoiler: it never works* 🤷‍♂️) and a husband trying to impress my wife with my never-ending collection of tech toys 🎮.

But my story isn’t as straightforward as a clean line of code. Born in *New York* 🗽, raised in *Italy* 🇮🇹, and now back in the city that never sleeps, I’ve mastered the art of being a *wandering soul* 🌍.

My journey from *Italy* 🇮🇹 to *New York* 🗽 (and back again… and then back once more) isn’t just about geography. It’s about *chasing opportunities* 🚀, *embracing uncertainty* 🤞, and mastering the art of *gesticulating* 🤌 while debating whether New York bagels 🥯 can ever truly compete with *Italian bread* (*spoiler: they can’t, but they come close* 🍞).

I didn’t follow the usual path. I spent nearly a decade wrestling with a *computer science degree* 🎓 that didn’t fit how my brain works. But that struggle shaped me into a developer who thinks differently—who looks beyond the obvious and finds solutions in the *unexpected* 🔍. I bring that same mindset to my work, where I build systems that (*mostly*) don’t crash and fix bugs no one else wants to touch 🐛.

When I’m not coding, I’m navigating life as a husband and dad. I’m married to my *anchor* ⚓ and my biggest critic—who’s always *right* (and I hate that) 😅. We’re raising two incredible kids: one whose *curiosity* reminds me to keep asking questions 🤔, and the other who ensures I *never* get a full night’s sleep 😴.

I live in *Brooklyn* 🗽 but carry *Italy* 🇮🇹 with me—especially in my unapologetic love for *good food* 🍕 and my refusal to accept anything less than *perfection* ✨. My life is a blend of *Italian soul* and *New York grit*, and my work is proof that *breaking the mold* can build something better 🛠️.

This site is where my professional journey meets my personal chaos. Check out my [**Resume**](/resume) to see how I’ve turned mistakes into milestones. Or visit my [**Blog**](/posts) for my take on tech, life, and the constant quest for balance ⚖️.

***But fair warning:*** I’m *stubborn* about *Italian bread* 🍞.
