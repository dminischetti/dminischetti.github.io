## Purpose of these notes

This space extends the work I do for product teams every day—refining PHP codebases, unlocking database performance, and building systems that can handle the next wave of traffic. Writing forces clarity, and these articles document the trade-offs, tooling, and practices that keep platforms dependable.

### What to expect

- Deep dives on query tuning, observability, and benchmarking efforts from real projects.
- Architecture discussions that balance clean code with pragmatic delivery.
- Team practices that keep engineers shipping quickly without burning out.

If any post sparks an idea for your own platform, [reach out](mailto:dominic.minischetti@gmail.com)—I'd love to hear about it.
