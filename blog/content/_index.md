# **Welcome to My Sandbox**  

A **sandbox** is a place to **experiment, build, and explore**—and that’s exactly what this site is. Here, I share my journey as a developer, my thoughts on tech, and the occasional life insight. Expect a mix of **coding, problem-solving, and everyday adventures.**  

*(Why "sandbox"? In programming, a sandbox is a space to test ideas safely. This site is my personal sandbox—where I tinker, learn, and have fun! My daughter even drew a sandbox just for me. ❤️)*
