There was a time when **Facebook and Instagram felt like a lifeline**—a way to stay connected with friends, share life’s moments, and keep some kind of bridge between us.  

Then, at some point, **Mark Zuckerberg decided my nostalgia needed to be monetized.**  

These days, my Facebook feed looks like this:  

- **Ad**  
- **Ad**  
- Friend at the beach in Puglia (ouch, thanks for reminding me)  
- **Ad**  
- Friend eating fresh mozzarella (okay, now you’re just hurting my feelings)  
- **Ad**  
- Random guy trying to sell me crypto  

Meanwhile, I’m in New York, staring at a so-called "fresh" mozzarella ball that has the **texture of a wet sponge.**  

At some point, I had to ask myself: **Why am I still here?**

## **The Slow Goodbye**  

Leaving wasn’t a sudden decision. There was no dramatic *“That’s it, I’M DONE!”* moment.  

At first, I just **posted less**. Then I stopped checking notifications. Eventually, my accounts became **digital storage units**—just a place where old photos sat collecting virtual dust.  

And the strangest part?  

**No one even noticed.**  

The people who actually matter? **They already have my number.** They text, call, or WhatsApp me. They don’t need to **"like" a photo** to know I care about them.  

So again... **why am I still here?**

## **Social Media Isn’t About Friends Anymore**  

Remember when social media was about *your* friends? Now it’s just:  

- **Daniel San**, telling me **"Things I didn’t know before 30."** (*Listen, Daniel, I’m 46. At this point, I’m forgetting things I knew at 30. It’s called aging.*)  
- **Khaby Lame**, silently mocking viral idiots who complicate basic tasks. (*Okay, I admit, Khaby's funny. But how many potato-peeling hacks do we really need?*)  
- **Jay Shetty**, soothingly explaining how **deadlines don’t matter—inner peace does.** (*Jay, tell that to my landlord next month.*)  

Meanwhile, my actual friends? **Their posts are buried under 15 ads for things Alexa overheard me casually mention.**  

And when I *do* finally see them? It’s just another picture of them at a seaside restaurant eating fresh pasta, while I’m here in New York with a **manicotti dish that tastes like cardboard sadness.**

## **So, I’m Logging Out—For Good**  

It’s time to say **basta.** I’m not just *taking a break*—I’m **deleting my accounts completely.**  

But don’t worry, I’m not disappearing into thin air (though some days, I wouldn’t mind).  

If you actually want to stay in touch, you already know how to reach me:  

📞 **Call me.** Yes, phones still work for talking.  
💬 **Text or WhatsApp me.** I might take a while to reply, but I always do.  
✉️ **Email me.** I’m old enough to still like emails.  

Basically, if we’re real friends, **you already know where to find me.**  

And if you don’t?  

Maybe we were just **social media acquaintances.** And that’s okay too.

## **No Dramatic Goodbye—Just Moving On**  

So, that’s it. No emotional farewell, no deep soul-searching journey.  

Just **logging out and moving on.**  

See you on the other side. 😊
