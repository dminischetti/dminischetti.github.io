After I closed the door on social media, I found myself in a **quiet room**.

No scroll, no buzz, no filters. Just *stillness*.

And you know what? I didn’t miss it. Not even a little.

Life didn’t change. A couple of friends reached out privately, and it was fun—like running into someone at the market and chatting spontaneously. Maybe others will follow, maybe not. It’s fine. My days are still what they’ve always been: a little chaotic, often beautiful, and somehow always too short.

In this quiet room, I didn’t discover enlightenment or productivity hacks. I didn’t become a new person. I just realized I still like being me—**offline too**.

This blog isn’t a megaphone. It’s a **lamp in a quiet room**. A place to sit down, take off the performance, and speak plainly. If you’ve found your way here, welcome. I’m glad you did.

There’s a **moka on the stove**, quietly bubbling. The chair is yours if you want it.

I don’t know how often I’ll write. I just know that when I do, it will be *real*. No hashtags. No metrics. Just this.

Thanks for stepping inside.
