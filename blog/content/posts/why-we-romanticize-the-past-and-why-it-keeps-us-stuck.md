# **Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)**  

Ever caught yourself thinking, *“Things were better back then”*?  

Maybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just *felt* different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.  

I do this all the time.  

I think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.  
I remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being *disconnected.*  

And then, reality hits me: **the past wasn’t actually better. It just feels that way.**

## **The Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History**  

Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They **edit, distort, and reshape** them over time. And they’re *really* good at two things:  

1. **Blurring the bad parts.**  
   - We naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments.  
   - The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel.  
   - It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions.  

2. **Intensifying emotions.**  
   - Our best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified.  
   - The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt *magical.*  
   - We remember how we *felt*, not necessarily how things *were.*  

This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, *“They don’t make movies like they used to.”*  

It’s not that things were better. **It’s that we experienced them differently.**

## **Why We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us)**  

So why do we keep looking back?  

Because nostalgia is **a safe place**—one where we already know how everything turns out.  

And when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:  

They make the past feel **simpler, warmer, and more certain** than it actually was.  

Think about it:  

- **The ‘90s?**  
  We remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls.  
- **Childhood?**  
  We remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster.  
- **Early relationships?**  
  We remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion.  

I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.  
But I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.  

My brain **edited those parts out.**

## **The Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia**  

Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be **beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.**  
But it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.  

When we convince ourselves that the past was better, we **rob the present of its potential.**  

We start thinking:  
- *“Things will never be as good as they were.”*  
- *“I was happier back then.”*  
- *“The world is worse now.”*  

But was it really better?  
Or did we just experience it **differently**?

## **So... Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past?**  

Not at all. Nostalgia is **a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.**  

Here’s how I see it now:  

- **Instead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.**  
  - What made those times feel special?  
  - Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure?  
  - Maybe I need *more* of that in my life today.  

- **Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.**  
  - Every stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it.  
  - If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about **creation and purpose.**  

- **Instead of comparing, I create.**  
  - The past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today.  
  - The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again.

## **The Takeaway**  

Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a **mirror**—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.  

It’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.  
It came from **how we experienced it.**  

We were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.  

So next time you find yourself saying, *“Things were better back then”*, stop and ask:  

*Or maybe... I was just better at living in the moment?*  

Maybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how **distracted, rushed, and stressed** we’ve become.  

Maybe the best days aren’t behind us.  
**Maybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.**
