People think developers write code in a smooth, structured way—like some kind of **elegant digital architect**.

They imagine us sitting in front of a screen, effortlessly typing out **clean, efficient, well-documented functions**, sipping coffee, and feeling **in complete control**.

Yeah. **No.**

Here’s what **actually** happens.

---

## **Step 1: The Grand Vision** (*"I know exactly how to do this."*)  

You get the ticket. You think, *Oh, this is simple.*  

You crack your knuckles. Open your editor. Start typing with confidence.  

You’re in the **zone**. The code is flowing. You are an unstoppable force. A **coding genius.** You should write a book about this.  

---

## **Step 2: The First Run** (*"Why is it broken?"*)  

You confidently hit run.  

**Immediate error.**  

Okay, no problem. A minor fix. You run it again.  

**Different error.**  

You frown. Maybe you mistyped something? You check the function names. Everything **looks** correct.  

Run it again.  

Now it’s **really** broken.  

This is the moment you realize: *You have no idea what you’re doing.*  

---

## **Step 3: The Google Phase** (*"Surely someone has solved this before."*)  

You open Google. You type something completely ridiculous, like:  

> **"PHP array error help please what is happening"**  

You find a **Stack Overflow thread from 2012.** Someone had a similar problem. The top answer is:  

> *"Have you tried restarting your computer?"*  

You scroll down. Another answer **looks promising.** You copy and paste the code **without reading it.**  

It **doesn't work.**  

---

## **Step 4: The Deep Spiral** (*"I have made a terrible mistake."*)  

You start adding **random print statements.**  

You go **deeper** into Stack Overflow. You start reading answers from **people who sound like they barely know what they’re doing**—but at this point, you’re desperate.  

You begin **questioning your life choices.**  

*Maybe I should’ve been a chef? People always need food. Nobody ever asks a steak why it’s not iterating through an array properly.*  

---

## **Step 5: The Accidental Fix** (*"Wait... what?")*  

You change **one tiny thing**—maybe a missing semicolon, maybe a different variable name—and suddenly…  

**It works.**  

You **don’t know why.** You **don’t care.**  

You immediately push the fix **before it breaks again.**  

---

## **Step 6: The "Good Enough" Phase** (*"I’ll refactor this later."*)  

You know the code is **messy.** You **know** future-you will hate this.  

But you tell yourself:  

*"I’ll clean it up later."*  

**You never do.**  

---

## **Step 7: The Code Review Horror** (*"What was I thinking?"*)  

Two weeks later, someone **reviews your code.**  

> **"Hey, why is there a `console.log('WHY IS THIS BROKEN')` in here?"**  

> **"Is this function name supposed to be `fixThisPleaseFinal_v3()`?"**  

> **"Did you… copy this from Stack Overflow?"**  

You **avoid eye contact.** You **pretend you didn’t see the comments.**  

You **consider changing your name and moving to another country.**  

But eventually, you fix it. You push the final version. The PR gets approved.  

And then…  

A new ticket comes in.  

And the **cycle begins again.**
