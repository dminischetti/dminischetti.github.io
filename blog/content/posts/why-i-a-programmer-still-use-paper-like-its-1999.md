# **Why I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999**  

I spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues. Everything I do is digital.  

And yet, whenever I need to **truly think**, whenever I need to **solve a problem**, I reach for something ancient.  

**Paper.**  

Yes, real, dead-tree, old-school **paper**. With an **actual pen.** No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.

## **Why Do I Do This?**  

People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.  

*"You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?"*  

I tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.  

But every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.  

With paper, I can:  
- **Think freely** without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications.  
- **Draw connections** with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate.  
- **Physically slow down**, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving.  

I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because **it works.**

## **The Problem with Digital Thinking**  

I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:  

They make **everything too neat.**  

Typing forces you into a **linear thought process**. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.  

But real problem-solving? **It’s messy.**  

It’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.  

Digital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.  

When I write on paper, I’m **not editing as I think.** I’m letting ideas **collide**, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.

## **Paper is My Debugging Tool**  

For some people, thinking happens **on the keyboard**.  

For me, thinking happens **with a pen.**  

It’s not just about notes—it’s about **clarity**. It’s about **processing**. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.  

- **Before I write code, I write on paper.** I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture.  
- **Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out.** I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster.  
- **Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page.** I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios.  

By the time I finally touch the keyboard, **I already know what I’m doing.**

## **The Takeaway**  

People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job **isn’t the newest or the most advanced**—it’s just the one that works.  

No productivity hack replaces **thinking**.  
No app mimics **messy creativity**.  
No digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.  

So yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.  

But also? **Watch me solve problems faster than you.**  

Because in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.
