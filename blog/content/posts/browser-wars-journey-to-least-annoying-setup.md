I’m a software developer. I build things for the web. I write code.  
I understand how browsers work.  

And yet, somehow, **choosing a default browser nearly broke me.**  

It wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. **It’s just a browser.**  
A glorified **tab holder**. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.  

But the moment I tried to pick *the one*—**the browser that would rule them all**—I descended into **a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.**

## **Round 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison)**  

I thought I had a choice.  

I really did.  

I believed I could just **install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone** and live a normal life.  

What a fool I was.  

Because Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you **use** a real browser on iOS.  
No matter what I install—**Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels**—they’re **all WebKit underneath.**  

Which means every browser on iPhone is just **Safari wearing a cheap disguise.**  

- **Chrome?** Safari with Google Sync.  
- **Firefox?** Safari with different branding.  
- **Brave?** Safari with a tinfoil hat.  

There is no escape. Safari is the law.  

I tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, **convincing myself it was different.**  
It wasn’t.  

The pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.  
The only difference? **A Google logo and more tracking.**  

At some point, I accepted my fate. **If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.**  

Fine. **Safari wins on iPhone.**  
Not because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a **slow, battery-draining death.**

## **Round 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway)**  

On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. **Freedom.**  

Or so I thought.  

In reality, **every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.**  

- **Chrome** – The original Chromium overlord. **Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport** and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist.  
- **Brave** – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. **Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto?**  
- **Vivaldi** – For people who think **customizing a browser is a personality trait.**  
- **Opera** – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? **Reveal yourselves.**  
- **Firefox** – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. **But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off**, and the font rendering gives me trust issues.  

At this point, I realized something horrifying.  

**Every time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.**  

Not because I *wanted* to, but because **the entire web is optimized for Chromium.**  

I wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that **the slightly-off fonts were a feature.**  
But in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an **alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.**  

So, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use **the version that’s optimized for Windows** and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.  

And that’s how **Edge won by default.**

## **Round 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together)**  

So now I had:  

- **Safari on iPhone** (*because Apple won’t let me have nice things*).  
- **Edge on Windows** (*because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better*).  

But now came the **real** problem.  

**How do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?**  

- Google wants me to **use Chrome on everything** like some kind of cross-platform cult.  
- Apple wants me to **use Safari on everything** because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone.  
- Microsoft wants me to **embrace Edge fully** and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it.  

I refused to let any of them win.  

So I **hacked my way out** with **iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.**  

- Now **Safari and Edge share bookmarks** like two kids forced to get along.  
- I don’t need Google.  
- I don’t need third-party syncing tools.  
- And best of all, **I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks.**

## **Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie**  

After all this research, testing, and **questioning my life choices**, I have one conclusion:  

**All browsers are terrible.**  

- Some track you aggressively.  
- Some drain your battery.  
- Some crash randomly.  
- Some make you feel guilty for using them.  

But in the end? **A browser is just a tool.**  

The best one is **the one that gets in your way the least.**  

For me, that means:  

✔ **Safari on iPhone** (*because fighting Apple is exhausting*).  
✔ **Edge on Windows** (*because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration*).  
✔ **iCloud Sync** (*because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks*).  

Is it perfect? No.  
Is it better than switching browsers every week? **Yes.**  
Will I probably change my mind in six months? **Also yes.**  

Because let’s be real—**the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.**
