If you’ve ever worked as a developer, you know that **fixing a bug is never just fixing a bug**.  

It’s an **emotional rollercoaster**, a **psychological test**, and sometimes, **a personal attack on your own intelligence**.  

And no matter how many times we do this, it always follows **the same pattern**.  

---

## **1. Confidence** (*"This will be easy."*)  

You open the ticket, read the description, and think, *Oh, I see what’s happening. I’ll knock this out in 10 minutes.*  

Maybe you even tell your boss or a teammate:  
*"I’ll have a fix pushed soon."*  

(**A fatal mistake.**)  

Every. Single. Time. I convince myself that it’s just a quick fix.  
I even schedule my next coffee break around it.  

It’s like **walking into a trap you built yourself**… but you keep doing it anyway.  

---

## **2. Confusion** (*"Wait. What?"*)  

You try the **obvious fix**. It doesn’t work.  

You check the logs. **The logs don’t make sense.**  

You check the database. **The values should be correct.**  

You stare at the code like it **personally betrayed you.**  

You read the same line **ten times**, convinced you’re missing something.  
You start **questioning your sanity.**  

*"This should work. Why doesn’t it work?"*  

Welcome to the rabbit hole.  

---

## **3. Denial** (*"This bug shouldn’t even be possible."*)  

At this point, you start **questioning reality itself.**  

- *This code has been running fine for years. Why is it breaking now?*  
- *It works locally but not in production. What dark magic is this?*  
- *Did I introduce this bug? No… no, it can’t be me. Right? RIGHT?*  

At this point, I start suspecting **cosmic interference.**  

Mercury must be in retrograde.  
Maybe the server just hates me.  
Or maybe... just maybe...  

**The compiler is broken.**  

Clearly, **it’s not my fault.**  

It **can’t** be.  

---

## **4. Bargaining** (*"What if I just... add some debug logs?"*)  

You’re lost. Desperate.  

You start throwing in `var_dump()`, `console.log()`, and debug prints **like a mad scientist experimenting with electricity.**  

I’ve added **so many logs** that my console looked like **the Matrix**.  

*"Maybe if I just add one more debug statement, everything will make sense."*  

It **never does.**  

Nothing makes sense. You add **more logs.**  
You **commit to a full-on print statement religion.**  

The logs only make things **worse.**  

---

## **5. Anger** (*"WHO WROTE THIS CODE?!"*)  

You check `git blame`. You see a name.  

It’s **your name.**  

…Oh.  

This is the stage where I briefly consider **quitting tech and becoming a goat farmer.**  

Maybe life would be simpler if I just **herded goats.**  

Goats **don’t** have bugs.  

---

## **6. Acceptance** (*"Fine. I’ll actually debug this properly."*)  

You take a deep breath.  

You **go back to the basics**.  

Step through the code. **Check every assumption.**  
Slowly, painfully, you start to **understand**.  

You realize you were **overcomplicating things**.  
You stop treating it like a **personal attack** and start treating it like **a problem to solve**.  

And then, after **hours (or days)…**  

You **find it.**  

The bug.  

Some missing condition. A logic error. A typo.  
Something so **small yet so catastrophic** that you briefly consider quitting tech **again**.  

I’ve lost hours to a **misplaced semicolon**.  
I’ve questioned my **entire career** over a `<=` that should have been `<`.  

And in this moment? I feel **both victorious and ashamed.**  

---

## **7. Victory (and Regret)** (*"Fixed! …Oh no."*)  

You push the fix. You celebrate.  

You feel like **a god.**  

Then you look at the time and realize:  
**You just spent 6 hours fixing a one-line bug.**  

You close the ticket. You move on.  
You tell yourself **it won’t happen again.**  

But deep down, you know the truth.  

It **always** happens again.  

Because this is the life we chose.  

The **endless cycle** of **confidence**, **confusion**, **denial**, **bargaining**, **anger**, **acceptance**, and **regret**.  

And honestly?  

**I wouldn’t have it any other way.**
