# **The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck**  

For years, I waited for **motivation to strike**.  

I thought **productive people** had some kind of **magical drive** I didn’t.  
That one day, I’d wake up **full of energy**, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects **without procrastinating**.  

Guess what?  

That day **never came.**  

And it never *will.*  

Because here’s the truth:  

### **Motivation is a lie.**  

---

## **Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter**  

We’ve all said it:  

- *“I just need to get motivated.”*  
- *“I’ll start when I feel ready.”*  
- *“I don’t have the energy today.”*  

But **motivation isn’t something you *have*—it’s something you *create.***  

We think **action comes after motivation**, when really, it’s the other way around.  
### **Motivation follows action, not the other way around.**  

You don’t **wait to feel inspired** before starting.  
You start, and then **inspiration finds you.**  

Once I figured this out, **everything changed.**  

I used to wait for that **perfect wave of motivation**—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.  

Then I noticed something:  

### **I always felt more motivated after I started, not before.**  

Even if I *didn’t feel like it*—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.  
That’s when I realized:  

### **Motivation is a side effect of action.**  

---

## **What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple)**  

If I waited to *feel* motivated, I’d never do anything.  

So instead, I follow **three simple rules** that make action inevitable:  

---

### **1. The 5-Minute Rule**  

If something feels overwhelming, I **trick my brain** by saying:  

✔ **I’ll just do it for five minutes.** That’s it.  

- **Too tired to work out?** → *Five minutes of exercise.*  
- **Don’t want to start that project?** → *Five minutes of brainstorming.*  
- **Can’t focus on writing?** → *Five minutes of bad first drafts.*  

**90% of the time, I keep going.**  

Because **starting is the hardest part.** Once I’m in motion, **momentum keeps me moving.**  

And if I really **do stop after five minutes?**  
At least I did *something*—and something is infinitely **better than nothing.**  

---

### **2. The “No Emotion” Rule**  

I stopped asking myself **if I *felt* like doing something.**  

Feelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d **never get anything done.**  

So I stopped negotiating with myself.  

Now, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. **No debates. No negotiations.**  
It’s just **what I do.**  

✔ **Exercise?** → *It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”*  
✔ **Writing?** → *Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”*  
✔ **Starting work?** → *Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”*  

**Action first. Feelings later.**  

Surprisingly, **once I start, motivation usually shows up.**  

And if it doesn’t? **Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.**  

---

### **3. The 3-Choice Trick**  

When I don’t want to do something, I **limit my options** to just three:  

1️⃣ **Do it now.** (*Just start, even if it’s imperfect.*)  
2️⃣ **Do it badly.** (*Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.*)  
3️⃣ **Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.**  

Turns out, **staring at a wall is boring.** So I usually just do the thing.  

This trick works because it eliminates **all distractions**.  
I’m not allowed to **scroll on my phone** or **check social media**.  

My only choices?  
✔ **Work.**  
✔ **Do it badly.**  
✔ **Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.**  

And honestly? **Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.**  

---

## **Why This Works: The Science of Momentum**  

Newton’s First Law of Motion states:  
### **“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.”**  

Turns out, **this applies to humans too.**  

When we’re at rest (**not doing the thing**), it feels **impossible to get moving**.  
But **once we start**, it’s **easier to keep going.**  

This is why the hardest part of any task is **getting started.**  
It’s why the **5-minute rule works so well**.  

✔ **It breaks the inertia.**  
✔ **It removes overthinking.**  
✔ **It makes starting feel effortless.**  

And once you’re moving? **Momentum takes over.**  

It’s not about willpower.  
It’s about **tricking your brain into motion.**

## **The Takeaway**  

### **Motivation is a trap.** It’s not coming to save you.  

If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.  
If you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.  

But action? **Action leads to momentum.**  
And **momentum creates motivation.**  

So next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.  

✔ **Start for five minutes.** (*Even if it’s terrible.*)  
✔ **Do it without debating.** (*Feelings can catch up later.*)  
✔ **Give yourself only three choices.** (*Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.*)  

Because once you start, you *won’t* stop.  

And when you stop needing motivation to begin, **you’ll get more done than ever before.**
