Some people think **changing your mind is a weakness**—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That **certainty equals strength** and doubt makes you unreliable.  

I **completely disagree.**  

I change my mind **all the time.** Not because I’m indecisive, but because **I’m learning.**

## **The Art of Arguing With Yourself**  

It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, **your brain worked hard to form it.**  

And then, suddenly... doubt creeps in.  

You start thinking about the **opposite perspective.** You challenge your own logic. You realize, *maybe I was missing something.*  

Some people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: **every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.**  

I’ve realized that my opinions are just **snapshots** of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need **updates.**  

I constantly ask myself:  
- *What if I’m wrong?*  
- *What am I not considering?*  
- *How would someone who disagrees with me see this?*  

I argue **against my own beliefs** to test their strength. I look for **holes in my logic.**  

This isn’t being indecisive. **This is debugging my own thinking.**  

And every time I find a flaw, I fix it. **I upgrade.**

## **Marriage: The Ultimate Debate Club**  

If you want practice in **changing your mind**, get married.  

My wife and I **love** to debate. Not argue—debate.  

It starts with small things:  
- *Is this really the best way to load the dishwasher?*  
- *Is a hot dog a sandwich?*  
- *Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again?*  

Then, two hours later, we’re deep into **life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.**  

And sometimes, **we completely switch sides.**  

Not because one of us "won."  
Not because we’re trying to be "right."  

But because we actually **listened** to each other.  

Because **seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.**  

And yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.  
(Okay, **often** she’s right, but that’s another story.)  

But every time I admit I was wrong, **I get smarter.**  
And every time she does, **we both grow.**

## **Why Changing Your Mind is a Superpower**  

Here’s what I’ve learned:  

- If you never change your mind, **you’re not learning.** You’re just repeating yourself.  
- Admitting you were wrong **doesn’t make you weak.** It makes you someone people actually trust.  
- The smartest people **aren’t the ones who refuse to budge.** They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas.  

Think about it:  

Every time you change your mind, it means **you’ve learned something new.**  

- **Science evolves** by questioning and updating its ideas.  
- **Great leaders** adjust their strategies when new information comes in.  
- **Successful people** don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow.  

Changing your mind **doesn’t mean you were stupid before.**  
It means you’re **smarter now.**  

It doesn’t mean you were wrong.  
It means **you’ve improved.**  

And over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles **the truth.**

## **Version 2.0 (And Beyond)**  

I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.  
Now, I see it as **a sign of growth.**  

I don’t want to be **version 1.0 of myself forever.**  
I want to be **2.0, 3.0, 10.0**—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.  

Some people are **proud of being "consistent."** But if you’re consistent **just for the sake of consistency**, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.  

People who never change their minds? **They’re frozen in time.**  
People who adapt, question, and rethink? **They’re evolving.**  

And that means being willing to say,  
*"I was wrong."*  
*"I learned something new."*  
*"I’ve updated my thinking."*  

It means embracing **doubt, curiosity, and growth.**

## **The Takeaway**  

People think strength is about **sticking to your guns no matter what.**  
But real strength? **Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.**  

It’s about:  
- Being **curious** enough to question yourself.  
- Being **humble** enough to admit when you’re wrong.  
- Being **smart** enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.  

So the next time someone accuses you of **flip-flopping**, don’t take it as an insult.  
Take it as **proof that you’re evolving.**  

Because the strongest minds?  
They’re the ones that **never stop upgrading.**
