My brain works like an **action movie with no pause button**. **No clear story, no control**, and just when things start to make sense—BAM! **A sudden cut to something completely different.**  

One moment, I’m focused, working hard. The next?  

Oh wow, **did you know ancient Romans made concrete** that still exists today?  
Wait, wasn’t I supposed to answer an email?  
Oh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let me check...  
Wait. **What was I doing?**  

And just like that, 30 minutes disappear. I’m holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of **a completely different task** than the one I started.

## **The Productivity Toolbox: Everything I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work)**  

I’ve tested **every productivity method** I could find.  

- **Post-it Notes?** Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board.  
- **Timers?** Useful—if I remember I set them.  
- **To-do lists?** I write them, I admire them... I never check them again.  
- **Productivity apps?** I **collect them like Pokémon.** I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? **None work if I forget to open them.**  
- **Pomodoro?** Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists.  

I’ve heard all the usual advice:  
*"Just choose your priorities!"* But **everything** feels important.  
*"Use reminders!"* Great idea—if I remember to set them.  
*"Have you tried digital planners?"* Yes. I lost track of them too.  

It’s not that I don’t try. I do. But **my brain doesn’t follow the rules.**  

And yet… **I still get things done.**

## **How I Actually Get Work Done**  

I stopped looking for **one perfect system**—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of **simple tricks and mental hacks** to keep myself productive.  

- **One task at a time.** Multitasking? **I quit that.** If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing **nothing**.  
- **Writing everything down.** My memory is unreliable, so I put **everything** in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it.  
- **The Two-Minute Rule.** If something takes **less than two minutes**, I do it **right away**. Otherwise, it disappears into *“I’ll do it later”* (which means never).  
- **Multiple timers.** Since I forget I set a timer, I use **two or three different ones**. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer!  
- **Using my deep focus.** When my brain decides something is **THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD**, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned.  

But the most important thing?  

### **I Work With My Brain, Not Against It**  

I stopped trying to use **systems made for other people**. I can’t **force** focus, but I can **catch it** when it happens.  

If I suddenly get **super focused** on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I **write them all down** and organize them later.  

My productivity is not **straightforward**. **It moves in all directions.** And that’s okay.

## **The Tools That (Sometimes) Help**  

- **Notion:** My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion.  
- **Post-it Notes:** Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere.  
- **Timers (Lots of Them):** On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. *At least one might help me.*  
- **Single-tasking mode:** **One window. One tab. One job.** If I open a second tab, it means **I need to do it later.**  
- **Solid Starts:** Yes, even for feeding my son. Because **focus problems don’t take a break** when you’re a parent.

## **The Takeaway**  

Yes, my brain is **chaotic**. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have **a small collection of abandoned productivity tools**.  

But at the end of the day? **I get things done.**  

Not in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in **my way.**  

Because sometimes, **thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.**  

So if you ever see me **staring at the screen**, just know:  
- I might be solving a **complicated problem**...  
- ...or I might have forgotten what I was doing.  

Either way, **I’ll figure it out.**
