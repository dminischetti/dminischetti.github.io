# **The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive**  

For years, I thought I had **cracked the code** to getting things done.  

I was a multitasker—**a master of spinning plates.**  

✔ Answering messages while debugging code.  
✔ Cooking dinner while listening to a tech podcast.  
✔ Planning my week while pushing a stroller.  

I convinced myself this was **peak efficiency**.  

### **Turns out, I was dead wrong.**  

Multitasking isn’t a productivity hack. It’s **a scam**.  

And worse? **It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.**  

---

## **The Hidden Cost of Doing It All**  

We live in a world that **worships multitasking.**  

🖥 Job descriptions praise it.  
📈 Productivity gurus preach it.  
📱 If you’re not multitasking, you’re “falling behind.”  

But science—and **my own experience**—beg to differ.  

Multitasking isn’t **actually** doing two things at once.  

It’s **rapid task-switching**.  

And every time you switch, your brain **pays a price.**  

- **Jumping between Slack messages and writing code?** You’re not doubling your output—you’re introducing micro-delays that slow you down.  
- **Checking your phone while spending time with family?** You’re mentally buffering between two worlds—never fully present in either.  

I used to think multitasking kept me **ahead**.  

But it was actually the **thing keeping me stuck.**  

I was **always busy** but never *truly* productive.  

Then, I read something that **hit me like a brick:**  

### **“The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.”**  

And that’s when **everything changed.**

## **So Here’s What I’m Doing Instead**  

I’ve started embracing **single-tasking** like my productivity depends on it—**because it does.**  

---

### **1. Time-Blocking 2.0**  
I used to schedule my day **down to the minute**.  

It only made me **stressed** when things didn’t go as planned.  

Now, I align tasks with my **actual energy levels**:  
✔ **High-focus work** when my brain is sharp.  
✔ **Low-focus tasks** when I’m running on fumes.  

It’s about **working with my brain, not against it.**  

---

### **2. Digital Decluttering**  
I used to think a million open tabs meant **I was working hard**.  

Nope.  

It just meant **I was distracted**.  

Now, I:  
✔ **Close unused tabs.**  
✔ **Write down what I actually need.**  
✔ **Handle tasks *one at a time.***  

If something’s **important**, it goes on my **Notion board**.  
If it’s not? **It’s gone.**  

---

### **3. The “One-Tab Rule”**  
If my brain **wants a second tab**, it means **I need a second task slot later—not now.**  

This was **tough** as a developer.  

I’m used to juggling:  
✔ **Documentation**  
✔ **Stack Overflow threads**  
✔ **My IDE**  

But once I stopped, my **focus got sharper.**  

---

### **4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth**  
Instead of **half-absorbing** five articles, I **read one properly**—and actually retain something.  

✔ No more **fake productivity.**  
✔ No more **information overload.**  

The result?  
✔ **Deeper focus.**  
✔ **Lower stress.**  
✔ **Better work.**  
✔ **Actually being present in my own life.**

## **The Takeaway**  

We’ve been sold the lie that **multitasking is the key to success.**  

But what if the real key is **the opposite?**  

Imagine a world where we:  
✔ Stop bragging about **being busy**.  
✔ Start taking pride in **how well we do one thing at a time.**  

**Imagine how different life would feel.**  

I’m not perfect at it yet.  

I still catch myself **falling back into old habits**:  
✔ Checking messages while pushing code.  
✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.  

But now, I **notice it.**  

I stop.  
I refocus.  

I’m done with the **chaos.**
