      <title>How a CMS Can Make or Break Digital Publishing (And Why I’m All In with BLOX)</title>

      <description>A look at why a great CMS is essential for digital publishing, how BLOX Digital is leading the way, and why I&amp;#39;m excited about BLOX NXT.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever tried cooking a full meal with no kitchen tools? No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a <strong>Content Management System (CMS)</strong> feels like.</p>
<p>I should know. <strong>I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital</strong>, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. <strong>I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.</strong></p>
<p>For me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. <strong>That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.</strong></p>
<h2 id="so-what-exactly-is-a-cms">So, What Exactly Is a CMS?</h2>
<p>Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically <strong>the control center of a website</strong>. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content <strong>without touching a single line of code</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of it like a <strong>kitchen</strong>. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.</p>
<p>Without a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. <strong>It’s not pretty.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?</h2>
<p>Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced <strong>what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A painfully slow website</strong> (the kind that makes you question all your life choices).</li>
<li><strong>Articles impossible to find</strong> (why is the latest election update buried under &ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil&rdquo;?).</li>
<li><strong>A paywall that feels like a trap</strong> (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand).</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>good CMS</strong>, though? It keeps everything <strong>fast, smooth, and user-friendly</strong>. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists <strong>actually get paid</strong>.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what we do at <strong>BLOX Digital</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="why-blox-digital-and-why-im-excited-about-blox-nxt">Why BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT)</h2>
<p>At <strong>BLOX Digital</strong>, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build <strong>the CMS platform</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Powering 2,000+ news sites</strong> across the U.S.</li>
<li><strong>Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Helping media companies stay profitable</strong> while keeping journalism accessible</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how">How?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BLOX CMS</strong> – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes.</li>
<li><strong>BLOX Audience+</strong> – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense.</li>
<li><strong>BLOX YieldUp</strong> – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the thing I’m really excited about?</p>
<h3 id="blox-nxt-the-future-of-digital-publishing">BLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing</h3>
<p>BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism.</li>
<li><strong>AI-powered tools</strong> – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content.</li>
<li><strong>One-click publishing to multiple platforms</strong> – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place.</li>
<li><strong>A modern, intuitive interface</strong> – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.</p>
<p>Early partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.</p>
<h2 id="the-biggest-challenge-its-not-the-techits-the-people">The Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People.</h2>
<p>You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.</p>
<p>Guy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Basically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.</p>
<p>They see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because &ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line-my-job-and-my-blog-are-one-and-the-same">The Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same</h2>
<p>I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.</p>
<p>That’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.</p>
<p>My work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.</p>
<p>Newsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.</p>
<p>That’s why BLOX NXT matters. And that’s why I can’t stop talking about it.</p>

      <description>What I found after closing the door on social media: quiet, moka, and everything just as it was.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I closed the door on social media, I found myself in a <strong>quiet room</strong>.</p>
<p>No scroll, no buzz, no filters. Just <em>stillness</em>.</p>
<p>And you know what? I didn’t miss it. Not even a little.</p>
<p>Life didn’t change. A couple of friends reached out privately, and it was fun—like running into someone at the market and chatting spontaneously. Maybe others will follow, maybe not. It’s fine. My days are still what they’ve always been: a little chaotic, often beautiful, and somehow always too short.</p>
<p>In this quiet room, I didn’t discover enlightenment or productivity hacks. I didn’t become a new person. I just realized I still like being me—<strong>offline too</strong>.</p>
<p>This blog isn’t a megaphone. It’s a <strong>lamp in a quiet room</strong>. A place to sit down, take off the performance, and speak plainly. If you’ve found your way here, welcome. I’m glad you did.</p>
<p>There’s a <strong>moka on the stove</strong>, quietly bubbling. The chair is yours if you want it.</p>
<p>I don’t know how often I’ll write. I just know that when I do, it will be <em>real</em>. No hashtags. No metrics. Just this.</p>
<p>Thanks for stepping inside.<br>
- D.</p>

      <title>Why You Should Save Images as PNG Instead of JPG (Most of the Time!)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/</guid>
      <description>A breakdown of why PNG is often the better choice over JPG—because nobody wants their images looking like they were printed on a potato.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: <strong>PNG or JPG?</strong> And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you—<strong>it is</strong>. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Let’s get into it.</p>
<h2 id="1-png-keeps-your-image-sharpjpg-smudges-it-like-a-greasy-fingerprint"><strong>1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint</strong></h2>
<p>You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.</p>
<p>JPG <strong>compresses</strong> images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little&hellip; <em>off</em>.</p>
<p>PNG, on the other hand, keeps <strong>everything</strong>. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.</p>
<p>So, if you care about <strong>keeping things crisp</strong>, <strong>PNG is your best friend</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="2-transparency-because-not-everything-needs-a-white-box-around-it"><strong>2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It.</strong></h2>
<p>Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do <strong>transparency</strong>.</p>
<p>PNG? <strong>Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.</strong></p>
<p>This is huge if you’re working with <strong>logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images</strong>. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.</p>
<p>Or, you know, just <strong>use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="3-png-keeps-text-and-sharp-lines-looking-sharpjpg-butchers-them"><strong>3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them</strong></h2>
<p>JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into <strong>blurry, blocky nonsense</strong>. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.</p>
<p>If you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, <strong>stick with PNG</strong>. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.</p>
<p>And no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t <em>completely</em> fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.</p>
<h2 id="4-color-gradients-stay-smooth-in-pngjpg-turns-them-into-a-stripey-mess"><strong>4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess</strong></h2>
<p>You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression <strong>at work</strong>.</p>
<p>PNG keeps <strong>all</strong> the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”</p>
<p>If you’re working on <strong>art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade</strong>, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you <em>like</em> your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.</p>
<h2 id="5-you-can-save-png-over-and-over-without-losing-qualityjpg-degrades-every-time"><strong>5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time</strong></h2>
<p>JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality <strong>gets worse</strong>.</p>
<p>PNG? <strong>Doesn’t budge.</strong></p>
<p>This is <strong>huge</strong> if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re archiving old photos, <strong>PNG is the way to go</strong>. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, <em>“Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”</em></p>
<h2 id="but-waitwhen-is-jpg-actually-better"><strong>But Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better?</strong></h2>
<p>Look, JPG <strong>isn’t evil</strong>. It’s just… situational.</p>
<p>If you’re dealing with <strong>big photos and need to save space</strong>, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that <strong>don’t need to be perfect</strong>.</p>
<p>But if you’re working with <strong>logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine</strong>, <strong>PNG is the move</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>So next time you’re about to hit &ldquo;Save As,&rdquo; ask yourself: <strong>Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later?</strong> If the answer to any of those is yes, <strong>PNG all the way</strong>.</p>

      <title>Logging Out for Good: Why I’m Leaving Facebook and Instagram</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/logging-out-for-good-why-i-m-leaving-facebook-and-instagram/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/logging-out-for-good-why-i-m-leaving-facebook-and-instagram/</guid>
      <description>Social media was supposed to keep me connected with friends. Instead, it&amp;#39;s just ads, strangers, and reminders of things I can&amp;#39;t have anymore.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a time when <strong>Facebook and Instagram felt like a lifeline</strong>—a way to stay connected with friends, share life’s moments, and keep some kind of bridge between us.</p>
<p>Then, at some point, <strong>Mark Zuckerberg decided my nostalgia needed to be monetized.</strong></p>
<p>These days, my Facebook feed looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li>Friend at the beach in Puglia (ouch, thanks for reminding me)</li>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li>Friend eating fresh mozzarella (okay, now you’re just hurting my feelings)</li>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li>Random guy trying to sell me crypto</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, I’m in New York, staring at a so-called &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; mozzarella ball that has the <strong>texture of a wet sponge.</strong></p>
<p>At some point, I had to ask myself: <strong>Why am I still here?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-slow-goodbye"><strong>The Slow Goodbye</strong></h2>
<p>Leaving wasn’t a sudden decision. There was no dramatic <em>“That’s it, I’M DONE!”</em> moment.</p>
<p>At first, I just <strong>posted less</strong>. Then I stopped checking notifications. Eventually, my accounts became <strong>digital storage units</strong>—just a place where old photos sat collecting virtual dust.</p>
<p>And the strangest part?</p>
<p><strong>No one even noticed.</strong></p>
<p>The people who actually matter? <strong>They already have my number.</strong> They text, call, or WhatsApp me. They don’t need to <strong>&ldquo;like&rdquo; a photo</strong> to know I care about them.</p>
<p>So again&hellip; <strong>why am I still here?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="social-media-isnt-about-friends-anymore"><strong>Social Media Isn’t About Friends Anymore</strong></h2>
<p>Remember when social media was about <em>your</em> friends? Now it’s just:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel San</strong>, telling me <strong>&ldquo;Things I didn’t know before 30.&rdquo;</strong> (<em>Listen, Daniel, I’m 46. At this point, I’m forgetting things I knew at 30. It’s called aging.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Khaby Lame</strong>, silently mocking viral idiots who complicate basic tasks. (<em>Okay, I admit, Khaby&rsquo;s funny. But how many potato-peeling hacks do we really need?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Jay Shetty</strong>, soothingly explaining how <strong>deadlines don’t matter—inner peace does.</strong> (<em>Jay, tell that to my landlord next month.</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, my actual friends? <strong>Their posts are buried under 15 ads for things Alexa overheard me casually mention.</strong></p>
<p>And when I <em>do</em> finally see them? It’s just another picture of them at a seaside restaurant eating fresh pasta, while I’m here in New York with a <strong>manicotti dish that tastes like cardboard sadness.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-im-logging-outfor-good"><strong>So, I’m Logging Out—For Good</strong></h2>
<p>It’s time to say <strong>basta.</strong> I’m not just <em>taking a break</em>—I’m <strong>deleting my accounts completely.</strong></p>
<p>But don’t worry, I’m not disappearing into thin air (though some days, I wouldn’t mind).</p>
<p>If you actually want to stay in touch, you already know how to reach me:</p>
<p>📞 <strong>Call me.</strong> Yes, phones still work for talking.<br>
💬 <strong>Text or WhatsApp me.</strong> I might take a while to reply, but I always do.<br>
✉️ <strong>Email me.</strong> I’m old enough to still like emails.</p>
<p>Basically, if we’re real friends, <strong>you already know where to find me.</strong></p>
<p>And if you don’t?</p>
<p>Maybe we were just <strong>social media acquaintances.</strong> And that’s okay too.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="no-dramatic-goodbyejust-moving-on"><strong>No Dramatic Goodbye—Just Moving On</strong></h2>
<p>So, that’s it. No emotional farewell, no deep soul-searching journey.</p>
<p>Just <strong>logging out and moving on.</strong></p>
<p>See you on the other side. 😊</p>

      <title>The NYC Bread Hunt: How I Finally Found (and Made) the Perfect Loaf</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/nyc-bread-hunt-found-and-made-perfect-loaf/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/nyc-bread-hunt-found-and-made-perfect-loaf/</guid>
      <description>My personal journey from bakery-hopping frustration to homemade bread perfection, thanks to a surprise Christmas gift and a little Italian know-how.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-nyc-bread-hunt-how-i-finally-found-and-made-the-perfect-loaf"><strong>The NYC Bread Hunt: How I Finally Found (and Made) the Perfect Loaf</strong></h1>
<p>You ever bite into a slice of bread and think, <em>This is it. This is the one</em>?</p>
<p>Because for the longest time, <strong>I didn’t.</strong></p>
<p>Moving to <strong>New York</strong>, I figured finding good bread would be <strong>easy</strong>.<br>
I mean, it’s NYC! <strong>Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.</strong></p>
<p>But <strong>Italian-style bread?</strong> That was a <strong>different story</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="too-soft-too-sweet-too-tasteless"><strong>Too Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless?</strong></h2>
<p>The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>Too soft</strong>—like, <em>pillow</em> soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the <strong>crusty, chewy Italian bread</strong> I grew up with.<br>
2️⃣ <strong>Too sweet</strong>—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this <strong>weird sugary aftertaste</strong>. Bread <strong>shouldn’t</strong> taste like cake.<br>
3️⃣ <strong>Too tasteless</strong>—Some loaves looked great, all <strong>golden and rustic</strong>, but as soon as I took a bite&hellip; <strong>nothing.</strong> Just air and disappointment.</p>
<p>And don’t even get me started on <strong>the prices</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Artisan bakeries?</strong> Amazing.<br>
But unless I wanted to <strong>take out a loan</strong> for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-christmas-surprise-and-a-game-changer"><strong>A Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer)</strong></h2>
<p>Enter: <strong>My Wife, The Genius.</strong></p>
<p>Last Christmas, <strong>B (my wife)</strong> surprised me with a <strong>bread machine</strong>.</p>
<p>Honestly? I wasn’t expecting it.</p>
<p>I’d <em>casually</em> (let’s say &ldquo;casually&rdquo;) complained:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How expensive</strong> good bread was.</li>
<li><strong>How nothing</strong> tasted quite <em>right</em>.</li>
<li><strong>How I wished</strong> I could just make my own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom! <strong>Bread machine under the tree.</strong></p>
<p>(I love you, B ❤️)</p>
<p>Now, I’d <strong>love</strong> to say my first loaf came out perfect.</p>
<p>That I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created <strong>a masterpiece.</strong></p>
<p>But let’s be real—it was a <strong>disaster.</strong></p>
<p>Dense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep <strong>by the door in case of an emergency</strong>.<br>
(<em>Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.</em>)</p>
<p>Turns out, <strong>bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bread-flour-vs-regular-flour-and-the-quest-for-manitoba"><strong>Bread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba)</strong></h2>
<p>In Italy, we don’t have a <strong>special “bread flour”</strong> on supermarket shelves.<br>
Instead, we mix <strong>regular flour with Manitoba flour</strong>, which is <strong>high in protein</strong> and gives bread its structure.</p>
<p>Simple, right?</p>
<p>Well, try <strong>finding Manitoba flour in New York</strong>.<br>
I dare you. <strong>It’s like hunting for truffles.</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, I cracked the code:<br>
✔ <strong>Just buy bread flour.</strong> Problem solved.</p>
<p>But then I had <strong>another discovery</strong>—one that <strong>changed everything</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="semolina-the-secret-weapon"><strong>Semolina: The Secret Weapon</strong></h3>
<p>The first time I added <strong>semolina flour</strong> to my dough, I swear I heard <strong>angels singing.</strong></p>
<p>✔ <strong>The crust had that <em>snap</em>.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>The inside had more flavor.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>The whole loaf just felt… right.</strong></p>
<p>Not <strong>easy to find</strong>, but totally <strong>worth the effort</strong>.</p>
<p>And that’s the thing—<strong>bread-making is all about little improvements.</strong></p>
<p>I love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get <strong>even better</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I’ll tweak the hydration.</li>
<li>Maybe I’ll try a longer rise.</li>
<li>Who knows?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="is-it-cheaper-well-kinda"><strong>Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda.</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s talk <strong>cost.</strong></p>
<p>Making bread at home <strong>isn’t free.</strong><br>
Good flour isn’t cheap.<br>
And yeah, the <strong>machine itself was an investment</strong> (thanks again, B 😘).</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week?</strong> <em>Nope.</em><br>
✔ <strong>Is it way better than supermarket bread?</strong> <em>Absolutely.</em><br>
✔ <strong>Does it take more than four minutes of effort?</strong> <em>Not really.</em></p>
<p>Four minutes to throw ingredients in, <strong>press a button</strong>, and then <strong>just wait.</strong></p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>No kneading.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>No babysitting dough.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Just a little patience.</strong></p>
<p>And the best part? <strong>My house smells like a bakery every time.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-never-ending-bread-journey"><strong>The Never-Ending Bread Journey</strong></h2>
<p>So here I am, an <strong>Italian guy in NYC</strong>, still <strong>tweaking, learning, experimenting</strong>—</p>
<p>But finally—<strong>finally</strong>—<strong>happy with my bread.</strong></p>
<p>And if I ever move again (<strong>hey, it’s happened before</strong>), at least I know one thing:</p>
<h3 id="good-bread-isnt-something-you-find-its-something-you-make"><strong>Good bread isn’t something you find. It’s something you make.</strong></h3>

      <title>Why I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)</title>

      <description>Migrating from Jekyll to Hugo wasn’t as smooth as I expected, but it was worth it. Here’s what broke, what I learned, and why I’ll never go back.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too"><strong>Why I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)</strong></h1>
<p>I started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet. No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.</p>
<p>At first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… <em>until it didn’t.</em></p>
<p>Jekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slow build times</strong> – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee.</li>
<li><strong>Ruby dependencies</strong> – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon.</li>
<li><strong>Outdated themes</strong> – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ghost</strong> – Overkill for a simple blog.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress</strong> – Too bloated.</li>
<li><strong>Eleventy</strong> – Cool, but required too much setup.</li>
<li><strong>Pelican</strong> – Python-based, but didn’t click with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I found <strong>Hugo</strong>—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-i-stuck-with-github-pages"><strong>Why I Stuck with GitHub Pages</strong></h2>
<p>I kept everything on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s free</strong> – No hosting costs. Free is always good.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic updates</strong> – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Easy domain linking</strong> – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle.</li>
<li><strong>No maintenance</strong> – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish.</li>
<li><strong>Version control built-in</strong> – I can roll back changes if I break something (<em>which happens often</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-installing-hugo-for-once-a-smooth-setup"><strong>Step 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup)</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike Jekyll, which requires <code>bundle install</code> and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>On macOS</strong>:</p>
<p>brew install hugo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Windows</strong>: Download it from <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases">Hugo’s GitHub releases</a> and add it to your PATH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On Linux</strong>:</p>
<p>sudo apt install hugo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To verify the installation:</p>
<pre><code>hugo version
</code></pre>
<p>That’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-moving-my-jekyll-posts-this-should-have-been-easy-but"><strong>Step 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…)</strong></h2>
<p>At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s <code>content/posts/</code> folder, and everything would work.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<h3 id="what-broke"><strong>What Broke?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Folder structure</strong> – Jekyll stores posts in <code>_posts/</code>, but Hugo expects them in <code>content/posts/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Front matter differences</strong> – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON.</li>
<li><strong>Permalinks</strong> – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move the posts:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p content/posts
mv _posts/* content/posts/
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I had to clean up the front matter:</p>
<pre><code>find content/posts -type f -name &quot;*.
md&quot; -exec 
sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \;
</code></pre>
<p>That was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… <strong>until it isn’t.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-choosing-a-theme-a-black-hole-of-decision-making"><strong>Step 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making)</strong></h2>
<p>I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mainroad</strong> – Clean, but too plain.</li>
<li><strong>Anubis</strong> – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted.</li>
<li><strong>Hello-Friend</strong> – Nice, but missing features I needed.</li>
<li><strong>PaperMod</strong> – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installing PaperMod was simple:</p>
<pre><code>git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I updated <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>theme = &quot;PaperMod&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>For now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-4-fixing-my-broken-blog-because-of-course-it-was-broken"><strong>Step 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken)</strong></h2>
<p>I ran:</p>
<pre><code>hugo server -D
</code></pre>
<p>…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.</p>
<h3 id="what-went-wrong"><strong>What Went Wrong?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jekyll’s <code>/assets/</code> folder didn’t move</strong> – I had to copy it manually.</li>
<li><strong>Relative links broke</strong> – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll.</li>
<li><strong>Markdown formatting was stricter</strong> – Sloppy formatting? Not happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>After fixing those, my site <strong>finally</strong> worked.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-5-deploying-to-github-pages-this-also-should-have-been-easy-but"><strong>Step 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…)</strong></h2>
<p>Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Run Hugo’s build command</strong></p>
<pre><code> hugo
</code></pre>
<p>This generates a <code>public/</code> folder with the static files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push to GitHub</strong></p>
<pre><code> cd public
 git initgit add .git commit -m &quot;Deploy Hugo site&quot;
 git push origin main
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to automate everything.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-6-customizing-papermod-because-i-cant-leave-things-alone"><strong>Step 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone)</strong></h2>
<h3 id="enable-dark-mode"><strong>Enable Dark Mode</strong></h3>
<pre><code>[params] defaultTheme = &quot;dark&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="enable-search"><strong>Enable Search</strong></h3>
<pre><code>[outputs] home = [&quot;HTML&quot;, &quot;RSS&quot;, &quot;JSON&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="customize-sidebar-profile"><strong>Customize Sidebar Profile</strong></h3>
<pre><code>[params.profileMode] enabled = true title = &quot;About Me&quot; subtitle = &quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer&quot; imageUrl = &quot;images/profile.jpg&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Every time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="was-it-worth-it"><strong>Was It Worth It?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hugo is fast</strong> – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait.</li>
<li><strong>No more Ruby dependencies</strong> – No <code>bundle exec</code>, no errors, no wasted time.</li>
<li><strong>PaperMod works out of the box</strong> – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-id-do-differently"><strong>What I’d Do Differently</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually.</li>
<li>Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once.</li>
<li>Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-ill-keep-blogging"><strong>Why I’ll Keep Blogging</strong></h2>
<p>This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A personal blog is like a journal</strong> – It helps me organize my thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>It’s my escape from social media</strong> – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen.</li>
<li><strong>It’s mine, forever</strong> – No company can shadowban or de-platform me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.</p>
<p>What I do know is this:</p>
<p>I like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.</p>

      <title>Love Notes (and Bugs) in the Silence of Home</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/love-notes-and-bugs-in-the-silence-of-home/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/love-notes-and-bugs-in-the-silence-of-home/</guid>
      <description>A love story told in the quiet moments of working from home together.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work from home in an <strong>old Brooklyn apartment</strong> with high ceilings, creaky floors, and a history that whispers through the walls.</p>
<p>Our study is actually our daughter’s bedroom during off-hours, <strong>repurposed as a workspace</strong> where my wife and I sit at separate desks.<br>
Just enough space to pass between us. Close, but not too close—<strong>perfect for love and concentration.</strong></p>
<p>She’s studying to become an <strong>elementary school teacher</strong>, headphones on, eyes locked on her screen, so intensely focused that I’m convinced she could ignore a fire drill.<br>
I’m right beside her, <strong>lost in lines of PHP code</strong>, wrestling with bugs that refuse to die.</p>
<p>We don’t speak while we work. <strong>Not a word.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not that we don’t want to.<br>
It’s that we <strong>can’t afford to.</strong></p>
<p>Because if I say even a simple <em>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo;</em>, <strong>it’s over.</strong></p>
<p>Our daughter would appear out of nowhere, demanding to know why <strong>unicorns are magical</strong> or how <strong>rainbows work.</strong><br>
The baby would start crying, because <strong>chaos loves company.</strong><br>
And just like that, our fragile focus would shatter into a million pieces.</p>
<p>So, instead? <strong>We live in silence.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="secret-messages-without-saying-a-word"><strong>Secret Messages (Without Saying a Word)</strong></h2>
<p>Back when we first met at work, we <strong>flirted from separate desks</strong>, sending each other cheeky messages on the company chat.<br>
We couldn’t talk aloud—professionalism and all—but we found ways to make each other smile.</p>
<p>Not much has changed. <strong>We still send each other secret notes.</strong></p>
<p>Except now, they’re digital.</p>
<p>I’ll text her from two desks away:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Did you see the email?”</strong> (<em>Translation: “I miss you.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>“What’s for lunch?”</strong> (<em>Translation: “You’re beautiful.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>“This bug is killing me.”</strong> (<em>Translation: “I love you.”</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our messages are <strong>coded love notes</strong>, little signals in the middle of the workday.<br>
They keep us connected, even in silence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="stolen-glances-and-hidden-smiles"><strong>Stolen Glances and Hidden Smiles</strong></h2>
<p>I steal glances at her when she’s not looking.</p>
<p>Her laptop is open, her notes are neatly organized, and she has that look of <strong>fierce determination</strong> that could move mountains.</p>
<p>She’s beautiful, even when she’s stressed, even when she’s muttering facts under her breath.<br>
I want to tell her. But I don’t.</p>
<p>Because if I break the silence? <strong>The whole system collapses.</strong></p>
<p>We’d lose focus.<br>
Our daughter would rush in with questions.<br>
The baby would follow.<br>
And our carefully structured workday would spiral into <strong>pure chaos.</strong></p>
<p>So, instead, <strong>I stay silent.</strong><br>
And somehow, that silence says everything.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-silence-is-my-favorite-sound"><strong>Why This Silence is My Favorite Sound</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes, I hate working from home.<br>
I hate how <strong>work and life blur together</strong>, how emails never stop, how meetings pop up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>But <strong>I love this.</strong></p>
<p>I love this strange, quiet dance we do.<br>
I love the way we communicate without words, how we’re together yet apart.</p>
<p>I love the way she chews on her pen when she’s thinking, the way she sighs when she’s frustrated, the way she whispers to herself while studying.<br>
I love every little thing <strong>she doesn’t realize I notice.</strong></p>
<p>And even though she won’t look up, even though she’s too busy to see me staring—</p>
<p><strong>I smile.</strong></p>
<p>Because she’s mine.<br>
She’s always been mine.<br>
And in this <strong>shared silence, we’re still falling in love.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-invisible-love-story"><strong>The Invisible Love Story</strong></h2>
<p>This is our life.<br>
Our love.<br>
Our silence.</p>
<p>And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
<p>It’s not always perfect. We fight. We get tired. We get stressed.<br>
But in this space, in this shared silence, <strong>we find each other.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about grand gestures. It’s not about dramatic declarations.<br>
It’s about <strong>the little things.</strong></p>
<p>It’s the way she hands me my coffee without a word.<br>
It’s the way I fix her chair without her asking.<br>
It’s the way we both know when the other needs a break, even if we don’t say it.</p>
<p>It’s the way <strong>our love speaks in silence.</strong></p>
<p>And even on the hardest days, even when the baby cries, even when the code breaks—</p>
<p>I look at her and I know:</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly where I’m meant to be.</strong></p>

      <title>Notion: The External Brain That Finally Works for Me</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/notion-external-brain-that-works-for-me/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/notion-external-brain-that-works-for-me/</guid>
      <description>Struggling to keep track of your ideas and tasks? Discover why Notion is the external brain I never knew I needed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of my life, I’ve been at war with <strong>my own memory</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m great at solving problems, debugging complex code, and figuring out tricky logic flows. But ask me where I saved that important note from last week? <strong>Gone.</strong> Ask me what I was about to do five seconds ago? <strong>No idea.</strong></p>
<p>My brain has this incredible ability to cling to <strong>completely useless information</strong> while ruthlessly discarding the things I actually need.</p>
<p>I’ve spent <strong>years</strong> searching for a way to keep my thoughts, projects, and tasks organized. I tried:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Sticky notes</strong> (<em>good luck finding them when I actually need them&hellip; they vanish into another dimension</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>To-do list apps</strong> (<em>too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>Google Docs</strong> (<em>a black hole where ideas go to die</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>My own memory</strong> (<em>don’t even ask</em>).</p>
<p>Nothing worked.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled upon <strong>Notion</strong>, and suddenly, <strong>my brain had a backup system.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-notion-works-for-me-when-everything-else-failed"><strong>Why Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed)</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve always been skeptical of <strong>“all-in-one” productivity tools</strong>.</p>
<p>Every app promises to be <strong>the last one you’ll ever need</strong>—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either <strong>too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think</strong>.</p>
<p>Notion is the first one that actually <strong>adapts to me</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once.</strong> But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a <strong>blank canvas</strong>, and I decide the rules.</li>
<li><strong>The free version is actually good.</strong> Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using <strong>a relic from 2010</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>I can publish and share pages instantly.</strong> No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done.</li>
<li><strong>I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost.</strong> Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—<strong>they all have a home now.</strong> And somehow, I can actually <strong>find them when I need them</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before Notion, my workflow was <strong>a mess</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes buried in <strong>random text files</strong>.</li>
<li>Ideas scattered in <strong>Google Keep</strong>, which I’d forget existed.</li>
<li>Tasks floating in my head, <strong>patiently waiting to be forgotten</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now? <strong>Everything is in one place.</strong> Exactly where I expect it to be.</p>
<p>It’s like having my own <strong>personal knowledge base</strong>, and for the first time, I actually <strong>trust my system</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-about-the-offline-mode"><strong>What About the Offline Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>Yeah, I know—<strong>Notion doesn’t work offline.</strong></p>
<p>For most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? <strong>It doesn’t matter.</strong></p>
<p>I work <strong>online all the time</strong>. My job as a developer is remote. My files live in the cloud. My meetings are on video calls.</p>
<p>The only time I’d need offline notes is if I were <strong>stuck in a cabin with no internet</strong>—and at that point, I have <strong>bigger problems than note-taking.</strong></p>
<p>Like figuring out <strong>how to survive without Stack Overflow.</strong></p>
<p>For my actual, <strong>daily reality</strong>, Notion’s <strong>always-online</strong> approach isn’t a limitation.<br>
<strong>It’s just how I already work.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>I didn’t think I needed Notion.</p>
<p>I thought I just needed to <strong>be more disciplined</strong> or find the “right” system to organize my thoughts. I assumed <strong>I was just bad at remembering things</strong>, and that was that.</p>
<p>But now? <strong>I can’t imagine functioning without it.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt like your thoughts are <strong>scattered across a dozen places</strong>, if you struggle to <strong>remember things you actually need</strong>, if you’ve tried <strong>every productivity tool and nothing stuck</strong>—</p>
<p><strong>Notion might be exactly what your brain has been waiting for.</strong></p>
<p>And unlike my real brain, <strong>it actually remembers things.</strong></p>

      <title>The 7 Stages of a Developer Fixing a Bug</title>

      <description>Fixing a bug isn’t just about code—it’s an emotional rollercoaster. Discover the 7 stages every developer goes through while debugging.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever worked as a developer, you know that <strong>fixing a bug is never just fixing a bug</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s an <strong>emotional rollercoaster</strong>, a <strong>psychological test</strong>, and sometimes, <strong>a personal attack on your own intelligence</strong>.</p>
<p>And no matter how many times we do this, it always follows <strong>the same pattern</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-confidence-"><strong>1. Confidence</strong> (<em>&ldquo;This will be easy.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You open the ticket, read the description, and think, <em>Oh, I see what’s happening. I’ll knock this out in 10 minutes.</em></p>
<p>Maybe you even tell your boss or a teammate:<br>
<em>&ldquo;I’ll have a fix pushed soon.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>(<strong>A fatal mistake.</strong>)</p>
<p>Every. Single. Time. I convince myself that it’s just a quick fix.<br>
I even schedule my next coffee break around it.</p>
<p>It’s like <strong>walking into a trap you built yourself</strong>… but you keep doing it anyway.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-confusion-"><strong>2. Confusion</strong> (<em>&ldquo;Wait. What?&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You try the <strong>obvious fix</strong>. It doesn’t work.</p>
<p>You check the logs. <strong>The logs don’t make sense.</strong></p>
<p>You check the database. <strong>The values should be correct.</strong></p>
<p>You stare at the code like it <strong>personally betrayed you.</strong></p>
<p>You read the same line <strong>ten times</strong>, convinced you’re missing something.<br>
You start <strong>questioning your sanity.</strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This should work. Why doesn’t it work?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the rabbit hole.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-denial-"><strong>3. Denial</strong> (<em>&ldquo;This bug shouldn’t even be possible.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>At this point, you start <strong>questioning reality itself.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>This code has been running fine for years. Why is it breaking now?</em></li>
<li><em>It works locally but not in production. What dark magic is this?</em></li>
<li><em>Did I introduce this bug? No… no, it can’t be me. Right? RIGHT?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I start suspecting <strong>cosmic interference.</strong></p>
<p>Mercury must be in retrograde.<br>
Maybe the server just hates me.<br>
Or maybe&hellip; just maybe&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>The compiler is broken.</strong></p>
<p>Clearly, <strong>it’s not my fault.</strong></p>
<p>It <strong>can’t</strong> be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-bargaining-"><strong>4. Bargaining</strong> (<em>&ldquo;What if I just&hellip; add some debug logs?&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You’re lost. Desperate.</p>
<p>You start throwing in <code>var_dump()</code>, <code>console.log()</code>, and debug prints <strong>like a mad scientist experimenting with electricity.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve added <strong>so many logs</strong> that my console looked like <strong>the Matrix</strong>.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Maybe if I just add one more debug statement, everything will make sense.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It <strong>never does.</strong></p>
<p>Nothing makes sense. You add <strong>more logs.</strong><br>
You <strong>commit to a full-on print statement religion.</strong></p>
<p>The logs only make things <strong>worse.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-anger-"><strong>5. Anger</strong> (<em>&ldquo;WHO WROTE THIS CODE?!&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You check <code>git blame</code>. You see a name.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>your name.</strong></p>
<p>…Oh.</p>
<p>This is the stage where I briefly consider <strong>quitting tech and becoming a goat farmer.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe life would be simpler if I just <strong>herded goats.</strong></p>
<p>Goats <strong>don’t</strong> have bugs.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-acceptance-"><strong>6. Acceptance</strong> (<em>&ldquo;Fine. I’ll actually debug this properly.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You take a deep breath.</p>
<p>You <strong>go back to the basics</strong>.</p>
<p>Step through the code. <strong>Check every assumption.</strong><br>
Slowly, painfully, you start to <strong>understand</strong>.</p>
<p>You realize you were <strong>overcomplicating things</strong>.<br>
You stop treating it like a <strong>personal attack</strong> and start treating it like <strong>a problem to solve</strong>.</p>
<p>And then, after <strong>hours (or days)…</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>find it.</strong></p>
<p>The bug.</p>
<p>Some missing condition. A logic error. A typo.<br>
Something so <strong>small yet so catastrophic</strong> that you briefly consider quitting tech <strong>again</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve lost hours to a <strong>misplaced semicolon</strong>.<br>
I’ve questioned my <strong>entire career</strong> over a <code>&lt;=</code> that should have been <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<p>And in this moment? I feel <strong>both victorious and ashamed.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-victory-and-regret-"><strong>7. Victory (and Regret)</strong> (<em>&ldquo;Fixed! …Oh no.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You push the fix. You celebrate.</p>
<p>You feel like <strong>a god.</strong></p>
<p>Then you look at the time and realize:<br>
<strong>You just spent 6 hours fixing a one-line bug.</strong></p>
<p>You close the ticket. You move on.<br>
You tell yourself <strong>it won’t happen again.</strong></p>
<p>But deep down, you know the truth.</p>
<p>It <strong>always</strong> happens again.</p>
<p>Because this is the life we chose.</p>
<p>The <strong>endless cycle</strong> of <strong>confidence</strong>, <strong>confusion</strong>, <strong>denial</strong>, <strong>bargaining</strong>, <strong>anger</strong>, <strong>acceptance</strong>, and <strong>regret</strong>.</p>
<p>And honestly?</p>
<p><strong>I wouldn’t have it any other way.</strong></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-multitasking-myth-why-doing-less-makes-you-more-productive"><strong>The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought I had <strong>cracked the code</strong> to getting things done.</p>
<p>I was a multitasker—<strong>a master of spinning plates.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Answering messages while debugging code.<br>
✔ Cooking dinner while listening to a tech podcast.<br>
✔ Planning my week while pushing a stroller.</p>
<p>I convinced myself this was <strong>peak efficiency</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="turns-out-i-was-dead-wrong"><strong>Turns out, I was dead wrong.</strong></h3>
<p>Multitasking isn’t a productivity hack. It’s <strong>a scam</strong>.</p>
<p>And worse? <strong>It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-hidden-cost-of-doing-it-all"><strong>The Hidden Cost of Doing It All</strong></h2>
<p>We live in a world that <strong>worships multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>🖥 Job descriptions praise it.<br>
📈 Productivity gurus preach it.<br>
📱 If you’re not multitasking, you’re “falling behind.”</p>
<p>But science—and <strong>my own experience</strong>—beg to differ.</p>
<p>Multitasking isn’t <strong>actually</strong> doing two things at once.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>rapid task-switching</strong>.</p>
<p>And every time you switch, your brain <strong>pays a price.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jumping between Slack messages and writing code?</strong> You’re not doubling your output—you’re introducing micro-delays that slow you down.</li>
<li><strong>Checking your phone while spending time with family?</strong> You’re mentally buffering between two worlds—never fully present in either.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to think multitasking kept me <strong>ahead</strong>.</p>
<p>But it was actually the <strong>thing keeping me stuck.</strong></p>
<p>I was <strong>always busy</strong> but never <em>truly</em> productive.</p>
<p>Then, I read something that <strong>hit me like a brick:</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-ability-to-single-task-is-becoming-a-superpower"><strong>“The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.”</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s when <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-heres-what-im-doing-instead"><strong>So Here’s What I’m Doing Instead</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve started embracing <strong>single-tasking</strong> like my productivity depends on it—<strong>because it does.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-time-blocking-20"><strong>1. Time-Blocking 2.0</strong></h3>
<p>I used to schedule my day <strong>down to the minute</strong>.</p>
<p>It only made me <strong>stressed</strong> when things didn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>Now, I align tasks with my <strong>actual energy levels</strong>:<br>
✔ <strong>High-focus work</strong> when my brain is sharp.<br>
✔ <strong>Low-focus tasks</strong> when I’m running on fumes.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>working with my brain, not against it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-digital-decluttering"><strong>2. Digital Decluttering</strong></h3>
<p>I used to think a million open tabs meant <strong>I was working hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>It just meant <strong>I was distracted</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I:<br>
✔ <strong>Close unused tabs.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Write down what I actually need.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Handle tasks <em>one at a time.</em></strong></p>
<p>If something’s <strong>important</strong>, it goes on my <strong>Notion board</strong>.<br>
If it’s not? <strong>It’s gone.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-one-tab-rule"><strong>3. The “One-Tab Rule”</strong></h3>
<p>If my brain <strong>wants a second tab</strong>, it means <strong>I need a second task slot later—not now.</strong></p>
<p>This was <strong>tough</strong> as a developer.</p>
<p>I’m used to juggling:<br>
✔ <strong>Documentation</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Stack Overflow threads</strong><br>
✔ <strong>My IDE</strong></p>
<p>But once I stopped, my <strong>focus got sharper.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-thinking-in-depth-not-breadth"><strong>4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of <strong>half-absorbing</strong> five articles, I <strong>read one properly</strong>—and actually retain something.</p>
<p>✔ No more <strong>fake productivity.</strong><br>
✔ No more <strong>information overload.</strong></p>
<p>The result?<br>
✔ <strong>Deeper focus.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Lower stress.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Better work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Actually being present in my own life.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve been sold the lie that <strong>multitasking is the key to success.</strong></p>
<p>But what if the real key is <strong>the opposite?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a world where we:<br>
✔ Stop bragging about <strong>being busy</strong>.<br>
✔ Start taking pride in <strong>how well we do one thing at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine how different life would feel.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not perfect at it yet.</p>
<p>I still catch myself <strong>falling back into old habits</strong>:<br>
✔ Checking messages while pushing code.<br>
✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.</p>
<p>But now, I <strong>notice it.</strong></p>
<p>I stop.<br>
I refocus.</p>
<p>I’m done with the <strong>chaos.</strong></p>

      <description>Coding isn’t as glamorous as it seems. Discover the hilariously relatable stages every developer goes through while writing code.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People think developers write code in a smooth, structured way—like some kind of <strong>elegant digital architect</strong>.</p>
<p>They imagine us sitting in front of a screen, effortlessly typing out <strong>clean, efficient, well-documented functions</strong>, sipping coffee, and feeling <strong>in complete control</strong>.</p>
<p>Yeah. <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what <strong>actually</strong> happens.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-the-grand-vision-"><strong>Step 1: The Grand Vision</strong> (<em>&ldquo;I know exactly how to do this.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You get the ticket. You think, <em>Oh, this is simple.</em></p>
<p>You crack your knuckles. Open your editor. Start typing with confidence.</p>
<p>You’re in the <strong>zone</strong>. The code is flowing. You are an unstoppable force. A <strong>coding genius.</strong> You should write a book about this.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-2-the-first-run-"><strong>Step 2: The First Run</strong> (<em>&ldquo;Why is it broken?&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You confidently hit run.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate error.</strong></p>
<p>Okay, no problem. A minor fix. You run it again.</p>
<p><strong>Different error.</strong></p>
<p>You frown. Maybe you mistyped something? You check the function names. Everything <strong>looks</strong> correct.</p>
<p>Run it again.</p>
<p>Now it’s <strong>really</strong> broken.</p>
<p>This is the moment you realize: <em>You have no idea what you’re doing.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-3-the-google-phase-"><strong>Step 3: The Google Phase</strong> (<em>&ldquo;Surely someone has solved this before.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You open Google. You type something completely ridiculous, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;PHP array error help please what is happening&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>You find a <strong>Stack Overflow thread from 2012.</strong> Someone had a similar problem. The top answer is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Have you tried restarting your computer?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>You scroll down. Another answer <strong>looks promising.</strong> You copy and paste the code <strong>without reading it.</strong></p>
<p>It <strong>doesn&rsquo;t work.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-4-the-deep-spiral-"><strong>Step 4: The Deep Spiral</strong> (<em>&ldquo;I have made a terrible mistake.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You start adding <strong>random print statements.</strong></p>
<p>You go <strong>deeper</strong> into Stack Overflow. You start reading answers from <strong>people who sound like they barely know what they’re doing</strong>—but at this point, you’re desperate.</p>
<p>You begin <strong>questioning your life choices.</strong></p>
<p><em>Maybe I should’ve been a chef? People always need food. Nobody ever asks a steak why it’s not iterating through an array properly.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-5-the-accidental-fix-"><strong>Step 5: The Accidental Fix</strong> (<em>&ldquo;Wait&hellip; what?&rdquo;)</em></h2>
<p>You change <strong>one tiny thing</strong>—maybe a missing semicolon, maybe a different variable name—and suddenly…</p>
<p><strong>It works.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>don’t know why.</strong> You <strong>don’t care.</strong></p>
<p>You immediately push the fix <strong>before it breaks again.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-6-the--"><strong>Step 6: The &ldquo;Good Enough&rdquo; Phase</strong> (<em>&ldquo;I’ll refactor this later.&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>You know the code is <strong>messy.</strong> You <strong>know</strong> future-you will hate this.</p>
<p>But you tell yourself:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I’ll clean it up later.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>You never do.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-7-the-code-review-horror-"><strong>Step 7: The Code Review Horror</strong> (<em>&ldquo;What was I thinking?&rdquo;</em>)</h2>
<p>Two weeks later, someone <strong>reviews your code.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Hey, why is there a <code>console.log('WHY IS THIS BROKEN')</code> in here?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Is this function name supposed to be <code>fixThisPleaseFinal_v3()</code>?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Did you… copy this from Stack Overflow?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>You <strong>avoid eye contact.</strong> You <strong>pretend you didn’t see the comments.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>consider changing your name and moving to another country.</strong></p>
<p>But eventually, you fix it. You push the final version. The PR gets approved.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>A new ticket comes in.</p>
<p>And the <strong>cycle begins again.</strong></p>

      <title>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</title>

      <description>Productivity isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing what matters. Discover how to escape the productivity trap and find real progress.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck"><strong>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought <strong>productivity was about doing more.</strong></p>
<p>✔ More tasks.<br>
✔ More efficiency.<br>
✔ More checkboxes.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t constantly <strong>optimizing, planning, and squeezing every second</strong> for maximum output, I was failing.</p>
<p>And at first? <strong>It worked.</strong></p>
<p>I was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.</p>
<p>But then something strange happened.</p>
<p>Despite all my so-called <strong>productivity</strong>, I felt like I was going <strong>nowhere.</strong></p>
<p>❌ <strong>Busy, but not fulfilled.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Efficient, but not effective.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Always working, but never actually moving forward.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s when I realized: <strong>The way we think about productivity is broken.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-false-promise-of-getting-more-done"><strong>The False Promise of “Getting More Done”</strong></h2>
<p>Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a <strong>lie</strong>:</p>
<p>🛑 That the key to success is <strong>efficiency</strong>.<br>
🛑 That if we just optimize our time <strong>perfectly</strong>, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-is-not-about-getting-more-things-done-its-about-getting-the"><strong>Productivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the <em>right</em> things done.</strong></h3>
<p>And if you’re not careful, <strong>“being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.</strong></p>
<p>I call it <strong>The Productivity Trap.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-productivity-trap-works"><strong>How The Productivity Trap Works</strong></h2>
<p>This is how most people approach work:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>You feel overwhelmed.</strong> Too much to do, not enough time.<br>
2️⃣ <strong>You try to optimize.</strong> Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.<br>
3️⃣ <strong>You get efficient&hellip; at the wrong things.</strong> Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually <em>matters.</em><br>
4️⃣ <strong>You stay stuck in a loop of busyness.</strong> Always “doing,” never really progressing.</p>
<p>This is the scary part:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-can-feel-like-progress-even-when-its-just-motion"><strong>Productivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion.</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.</p>
<p>I was <strong>checking boxes but not moving forward</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>working hard but not working smart</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>busy—but not productive.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-real-secret-to-productivity-subtraction-not-addition"><strong>The Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition</strong></h2>
<p>I used to ask myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I ask a <strong>better</strong> question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What can I remove?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Real productivity isn’t about <strong>adding</strong> more tasks.</p>
<p>It’s about:<br>
✔ <strong>Eliminating distractions.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Cutting useless work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Focusing on what actually moves the needle.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I flipped my mindset:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-stop-optimizing-the-unimportant"><strong>1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant</strong></h3>
<p>I used to spend <strong>hours</strong> tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.</p>
<p>It felt productive, but in reality? <strong>It was just procrastination in disguise.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does this task even matter?</em></li>
<li><em>Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, the best way to <strong>be more productive</strong> is to <strong>stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-8020-focus-shift"><strong>2. The 80/20 Focus Shift</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Pareto Principle</strong> says <strong>80% of results come from 20% of effort.</strong></p>
<p>But most of us spend time on the <strong>80% of tasks</strong> that don’t actually move the needle.</p>
<p>So instead of asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I ask:<br>
✔ <em>What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?</em><br>
✔ <em>What can I cut without any real consequence?</em></p>
<p>Then, I <strong>ruthlessly</strong> focus on the <strong>high-impact 20%</strong>—and let go of the rest.</p>
<p>This was a game-changer for me. It’s not about <strong>doing everything</strong>. It’s about doing <strong>the right things.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-single-tasking-the-real-superpower"><strong>3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower</strong></h3>
<p>I used to <strong>pride myself on multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>But <strong>multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.</strong></p>
<p>It’s just rapidly <strong>switching between tasks</strong>, losing focus each time.</p>
<p>Now, I do the opposite:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>One tab at a time.</strong> No distractions.<br>
✔ <strong>One task at a time.</strong> Full focus, deep work.<br>
✔ <strong>One decision at a time.</strong> No jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>It <strong>feels</strong> slower, but in reality? <strong>It’s 10x more effective.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-the-do-less-but-better-rule"><strong>4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>Most people try to do everything <strong>at 70% effort.</strong></p>
<p>They spread themselves too thin, and their work <strong>suffers.</strong></p>
<p>But the real magic happens when you:</p>
<p>✔ Do <strong>fewer</strong> things, but do them <strong>exceptionally well.</strong><br>
✔ Say <strong>no</strong> to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.<br>
✔ Focus on <strong>quality over quantity.</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, by <strong>doing less, you achieve more.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway-stop-measuring-productivity-by-output"><strong>The Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest shift I made?</p>
<p>I stopped measuring productivity by <strong>how much I do.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, I measure it by:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>How much progress I make on things that actually matter.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much energy I have left at the end of the day.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.</strong></p>
<p>I stopped asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And started asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How can I do less, but better?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="if-youre-feeling-stuck-try-this"><strong>If You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This</strong></h2>
<p>If you’ve been <strong>optimizing, planning, and working harder</strong>—but still feel stuck?</p>
<p>Try the <strong>opposite.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Instead of doing more, <strong>do less—strategically.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of working harder, <strong>work on the right things.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, <strong>chase clarity.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>the most productive people</strong> aren’t the ones who get the most done.</p>
<p>They’re the ones who <strong>do what matters—and ignore everything else.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the secret.</p>
<p>It’s not about <strong>doing more.</strong><br>
It’s about <strong>doing less—but doing it better.</strong></p>

      <title>I Never Thought I’d Grow a Beard (But Here We Are)</title>

      <description>Growing a beard was never in my plans. But this accidental experiment taught me more about identity than I expected.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been a <strong>beard guy.</strong></p>
<p>For most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just <strong>happened</strong> to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age. I’d see guys with <strong>thick, full beards</strong> and think, <em>Yeah, that’s just not for me.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I shave because I always have.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>I’m just not a beard person.</strong></p>
<p>And then, one day&hellip; <strong>I didn’t shave.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-accidental-beard-experiment"><strong>The Accidental Beard Experiment</strong></h2>
<p>I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, <em>I shall grow a beard!</em></p>
<p>It started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had <strong>more stubble than usual.</strong></p>
<p>Normally, this would have <strong>annoyed me.</strong> But this time?</p>
<p>I let it stay.</p>
<p>At first, it felt weird—like my <strong>own face was betraying me.</strong> I&rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, <em>Who is this guy?</em></p>
<p>The <strong>itchy phase</strong> was real.<br>
The <strong>awkward patchy phase</strong> was even more real.</p>
<p>But the strangest part?</p>
<p>I <strong>kind of liked it.</strong></p>
<p>I started noticing little things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It made me <strong>look older</strong> (or maybe just <em>different</em>).</li>
<li>It <strong>changed the shape of my face.</strong></li>
<li>I kept catching myself <strong>stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a <strong>reminder</strong> that something was changing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-growing-a-beard-felt-so-different"><strong>Why Growing a Beard Felt So… Different</strong></h2>
<p>It’s funny how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can change the way you see yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I looked different.</strong> My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a <strong>real-life Instagram filter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I felt different.</strong> There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more <strong>deliberate.</strong> Like I had <em>made a choice</em>, even if that choice was just to&hellip; not shave.</li>
<li><strong>Other people noticed.</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;You look… more Italian now.&rdquo;</em> (<em>That one made me laugh.</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn’t prepared for how much <strong>other people</strong> would comment on it. It was like I had <strong>changed something huge</strong>, when all I did was&hellip; <em>nothing.</em></p>
<p>And every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of <strong>pride and discomfort.</strong> Like I was being <strong>seen in a new way</strong>—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-letting-my-face-do-its-thing"><strong>What I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing</strong></h2>
<p>Growing a beard <strong>didn’t change my life.</strong></p>
<p>But it did make me <strong>realize something important.</strong></p>
<p>So many of the things we believe about ourselves—our <strong>“defaults”</strong>—aren’t actually rules. They’re just <strong>habits.</strong></p>
<p>For years, I thought:<br>
✔ <em>I’m a clean-shaven guy.</em><br>
✔ <em>Beards don’t suit me.</em><br>
✔ <em>This is just how I look.</em></p>
<p>And then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” <strong>disappeared.</strong></p>
<p>It made me wonder:<br>
<em>How many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I’m not a morning person.</strong> (<em>Or am I just used to staying up late?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I don’t like public speaking.</strong> (<em>Or have I just never given it a real chance?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I’m not a beard guy.</strong> (<em>Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s strange how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can make you question so much more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="will-i-keep-it"><strong>Will I Keep It?</strong></h2>
<p>I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll <strong>shave it off next week.</strong><br>
Maybe I’ll <strong>keep it longer.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m just <strong>letting it be.</strong></p>
<p>No expectations. No rules. Just <strong>curiosity.</strong></p>
<p>But either way, this isn’t really about the beard.</p>
<p>It’s about realizing that sometimes, <strong>the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>That’s worth exploring.</strong></p>

      <description>Digital tools are powerful, but when it comes to problem-solving, nothing beats paper. Here’s why I, a programmer, still use analog methods.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999"><strong>Why I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999</strong></h1>
<p>I spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues. Everything I do is digital.</p>
<p>And yet, whenever I need to <strong>truly think</strong>, whenever I need to <strong>solve a problem</strong>, I reach for something ancient.</p>
<p><strong>Paper.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, real, dead-tree, old-school <strong>paper</strong>. With an <strong>actual pen.</strong> No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-do-i-do-this"><strong>Why Do I Do This?</strong></h2>
<p>People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.</p>
<p>But every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.</p>
<p>With paper, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Think freely</strong> without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Draw connections</strong> with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate.</li>
<li><strong>Physically slow down</strong>, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because <strong>it works.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-digital-thinking"><strong>The Problem with Digital Thinking</strong></h2>
<p>I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:</p>
<p>They make <strong>everything too neat.</strong></p>
<p>Typing forces you into a <strong>linear thought process</strong>. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.</p>
<p>But real problem-solving? <strong>It’s messy.</strong></p>
<p>It’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.</p>
<p>Digital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.</p>
<p>When I write on paper, I’m <strong>not editing as I think.</strong> I’m letting ideas <strong>collide</strong>, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="paper-is-my-debugging-tool"><strong>Paper is My Debugging Tool</strong></h2>
<p>For some people, thinking happens <strong>on the keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>For me, thinking happens <strong>with a pen.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just about notes—it’s about <strong>clarity</strong>. It’s about <strong>processing</strong>. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before I write code, I write on paper.</strong> I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out.</strong> I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster.</li>
<li><strong>Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page.</strong> I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time I finally touch the keyboard, <strong>I already know what I’m doing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job <strong>isn’t the newest or the most advanced</strong>—it’s just the one that works.</p>
<p>No productivity hack replaces <strong>thinking</strong>.<br>
No app mimics <strong>messy creativity</strong>.<br>
No digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.</p>
<p>But also? <strong>Watch me solve problems faster than you.</strong></p>
<p>Because in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.</p>

      <title>The Never-Ending Search for the Perfect App: Why I Can’t Stop Downloading</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/never-ending-search-for-the-perfect-app/</guid>
      <description>Obsessed with finding the perfect app? You’re not alone. Join me on my endless quest for the ultimate productivity tools.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people spend their free time <strong>watching movies, playing games, or reading books</strong>.<br>
I spend mine on an endless, slightly obsessive search for <strong>the perfect app.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what it is—<strong>file manager, calendar, task manager, note-taking app</strong>—if I use it daily, I want it to be <em>just right</em>.</p>
<p>But here’s the problem: <strong>it never is.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-app-store-illusion"><strong>The App Store Illusion</strong></h2>
<p>It always starts the same way.</p>
<p>I convince myself that somewhere, hidden among a sea of <strong>mediocre software</strong>, <strong>the perfect app exists</strong>.</p>
<p>So I start searching.<br>
Reading reviews.<br>
Watching <strong>YouTube comparisons at 2x speed</strong>.<br>
Checking <strong>Reddit threads full of people just like me</strong>—people who have fallen down the same rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I get lost in endless lists like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Top 10 Productivity Apps You Need.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Best File Managers for Windows and iPhone.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, I find something <strong>promising</strong>.</p>
<p>I download it, open it, start setting it up… and then the realization hits:</p>
<p><strong>Something is off.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The interface is <em>almost</em> perfect, but there’s <strong>one weird design choice</strong> that drives me insane.</li>
<li>The features are great, but <strong>why is there a subscription for this?</strong></li>
<li>It’s perfect on <strong>iPhone</strong>, but the <strong>Windows version looks like it was built in 2009</strong> and abandoned.</li>
<li>It’s perfect on <strong>Windows</strong>, but the <strong>iPhone version syncs once every full moon</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just like that, <strong>the cycle continues</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-do-i-do-this-to-myself"><strong>Why Do I Do This to Myself?</strong></h2>
<p>I know what you’re thinking:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Why not just pick one and move on?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Because that’s what <strong>normal people</strong> do. But my brain <strong>doesn’t work that way</strong>.</p>
<p>I need <strong>flow</strong> in my tools. If I open an app and something feels <strong>even slightly frustrating</strong>, it’s like an <strong>itch I can’t scratch</strong>.<br>
I’ll notice it <strong>every time</strong> I use it. And once I notice it? I <strong>can’t un-notice it</strong>.</p>
<p>I have a <strong>zero-tolerance policy</strong> for inefficiency:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>If an app takes more than two clicks</strong> to do something that should take one, it’s dead to me.<br>
✔ <strong>If it’s ugly</strong> or the design is inconsistent, I won’t use it, <strong>no matter how powerful it is</strong>.<br>
✔ <strong>If it’s perfect but has a monthly subscription,</strong> I will uninstall it <strong>on principle</strong>.</p>
<p>I want my apps to feel <strong>invisible</strong>, like they don’t exist. They should <strong>just work</strong> without reminding me they’re there.</p>
<p>The worst part?</p>
<p>The apps I abandoned <strong>months ago</strong>?<br>
Sometimes, I <strong>go back</strong>, thinking,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Maybe they fixed it. Maybe it wasn’t so bad.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It was.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-windows-vs-iphone-struggle"><strong>The Windows vs. iPhone Struggle</strong></h2>
<p>If you’re an Apple user, you know that <strong>Apple apps just work together</strong>.<br>
But try finding an app that <strong>works flawlessly on both Windows and iPhone?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good luck.</strong></p>
<p>I live in <strong>two worlds</strong>:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Windows for work.</strong> It’s where I <strong>code, debug, and spend most of my day</strong>.<br>
✔ <strong>iPhone for personal life.</strong> It’s where I <strong>organize tasks, take notes, and communicate</strong>.</p>
<p>You’d think by now, in 2024, we’d have <strong>seamless cross-platform apps that work beautifully everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone apps</strong> are <strong>beautiful</strong>, but their <strong>Windows counterparts</strong> feel like <strong>afterthoughts</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Windows apps</strong> are <strong>powerful</strong>, but most of them were <strong>designed by people who hate UI</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The “cross-platform” apps?</strong> Usually the <strong>worst of both worlds</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought switching to <strong>Android</strong> would solve this.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>It just gave me <strong>different</strong> problems.</p>
<p>I’ve even considered switching <strong>everything to Apple</strong>, but the thought of using <strong>macOS for development</strong> makes me break out in <strong>hives</strong>.<br>
I like my <strong>hardware customizable</strong> and my <strong>software open</strong>, thank you very much.</p>
<p>So I keep searching, hoping that <strong>one day, the perfect ecosystem will exist</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-inevitable-conclusion"><strong>The Inevitable Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, I’ve <strong>accepted my fate</strong>.</p>
<p>I will <strong>never</strong> settle.</p>
<p>I will always <strong>tweak, test, uninstall, reinstall, and repeat</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will keep <strong>switching between One Commander and Total Commander</strong> because <strong>each is 90% perfect but missing one crucial feature</strong>.</li>
<li>I will keep <strong>trying every new calendar app</strong> that promises to <strong>revolutionize scheduling</strong>, only to <strong>go back to Google Calendar</strong>.</li>
<li>I will keep hoping that <strong>one day, Fantastical will magically become cross-platform</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe <strong>there is no perfect app</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem <strong>isn’t the apps—it’s me</strong>.</p>
<p>But until someone creates a:<br>
✔ <strong>Seamless</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Beautiful</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Feature-packed</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Cross-platform</strong><br>
✔ <strong>One-time-payment</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Ad-free</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Non-subscription</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Perfectly intuitive app for every function I need</strong>…</p>
<p>I’ll be here.<br>
<strong>Searching. Comparing. Complaining.</strong></p>
<p>And then <strong>downloading another one</strong>.</p>

      <title>The Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything</title>

      <description>Minimalism taken to the next level—finding the one perfect item for everything. Discover my quest for ultimate efficiency and portability.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything"><strong>The Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything</strong></h1>
<p>Most people <strong>collect things</strong>. I <strong>eliminate them</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale <strong>mission to find the absolute best</strong>—the <strong>one</strong> perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.</p>
<p>✔ One <strong>backpack.</strong><br>
✔ One <strong>pen.</strong><br>
✔ One <strong>pencil.</strong><br>
✔ One <strong>bathroom set.</strong></p>
<p>Everything I own must be <strong>the best, the most compact, the most portable.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Not as objects, but as decisions.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want five backpacks—I want <strong>one that does it all</strong>.<br>
I don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want <strong>one that feels perfect in my hand</strong>.<br>
I don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want <strong>one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn’t just minimalism.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>ruthless optimization.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-rules-of-the-game"><strong>The Rules of the Game</strong></h2>
<p>Finding <strong>The One</strong> is an <strong>art form</strong>. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about <strong>functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.</strong></p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>Compactness is king.</strong> If it’s too bulky, it’s out. <strong>Portability without sacrifice.</strong><br>
2️⃣ <strong>One item, zero regrets.</strong> Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. <strong>This is my Excalibur.</strong><br>
3️⃣ <strong>Quality over everything.</strong> If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. <strong>No disposable junk.</strong><br>
4️⃣ <strong>No over-engineered nonsense.</strong> If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I <strong>don’t want it</strong>. Keep it <strong>simple, durable, and effective.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t about <strong>being cheap</strong>. It’s about <strong>investing in the best, once</strong>—and then <strong>never thinking about it again.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-search-is-brutal"><strong>The Search is Brutal</strong></h2>
<p>You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.</p>
<p>Finding the <strong>one</strong> perfect item in any category means sifting through <strong>a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right</strong> options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The best backpack?</strong> Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. <strong>After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The best pen?</strong> Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream <em>pretentious fountain pen guy</em>. <strong>Found it. But wait—should I test one more?</strong></li>
<li><strong>The best toothbrush?</strong> Yes, even <strong>this</strong> is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. <strong>Why is this so hard?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each decision is a <strong>battle</strong>. A <strong>war between function and obsession.</strong></p>
<p>And the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.</p>
<p>❌ <em>“This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”</em><br>
❌ <em>“This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”</em><br>
❌ <em>“This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”</em></p>
<p>I fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make <strong>spreadsheets</strong> with pros and cons.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m <strong>that person.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-i-love-this-insanity"><strong>Why I Love This Insanity</strong></h2>
<p>Some people call it <strong>overthinking</strong>.</p>
<p>I call it <strong>engineering my life for efficiency.</strong></p>
<p>Because once I’ve chosen <strong>The One</strong>, <strong>I’m free.</strong></p>
<p>✅ No more switching.<br>
✅ No more rebuying.<br>
✅ No more second-guessing.</p>
<p>Just <strong>one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about <strong>reducing decision fatigue</strong>. It’s about <strong>knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me</strong>. It’s about <strong>portability, mobility, and adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s also about <strong>being prepared</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve moved across continents <strong>multiple times</strong>. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the <strong>freedom of traveling light</strong> and the <strong>nightmare of clutter</strong>.</p>
<p>So when the <strong>next big move</strong> happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>No clutter.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>No baggage.</strong><br>
✅ <strong>Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-final-boss-battle-of-minimalism"><strong>The Final Boss Battle of Minimalism</strong></h2>
<p>I’m not naive.</p>
<p>I know <strong>The One</strong> doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.</p>
<p>But the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about <strong>the mindset.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about <strong>curating my life</strong> to be as <strong>efficient and effective as possible</strong>. It’s about <strong>choosing quality over quantity</strong> in every decision.</p>
<p>So if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the <strong>final boss battle of minimalism</strong>.</p>
<p>And when I finally find <strong>The One</strong>?</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I’ll stop looking.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Until the next perfect version comes out.</strong> 😉</p>

      <title>How I Outsmart My Own Brain to Get Things Done</title>

      <description>Life feels like an action movie with no pause button. Here&amp;#39;s how I handle the chaos and still get things done.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My brain works like an <strong>action movie with no pause button</strong>. <strong>No clear story, no control</strong>, and just when things start to make sense—BAM! <strong>A sudden cut to something completely different.</strong></p>
<p>One moment, I’m focused, working hard. The next?</p>
<p>Oh wow, <strong>did you know ancient Romans made concrete</strong> that still exists today?<br>
Wait, wasn’t I supposed to answer an email?<br>
Oh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let me check&hellip;<br>
Wait. <strong>What was I doing?</strong></p>
<p>And just like that, 30 minutes disappear. I’m holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of <strong>a completely different task</strong> than the one I started.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-productivity-toolbox-everything-i-tried-and-why-it-didnt-work"><strong>The Productivity Toolbox: Everything I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work)</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve tested <strong>every productivity method</strong> I could find.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-it Notes?</strong> Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board.</li>
<li><strong>Timers?</strong> Useful—if I remember I set them.</li>
<li><strong>To-do lists?</strong> I write them, I admire them&hellip; I never check them again.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity apps?</strong> I <strong>collect them like Pokémon.</strong> I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? <strong>None work if I forget to open them.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pomodoro?</strong> Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve heard all the usual advice:<br>
<em>&ldquo;Just choose your priorities!&rdquo;</em> But <strong>everything</strong> feels important.<br>
<em>&ldquo;Use reminders!&rdquo;</em> Great idea—if I remember to set them.<br>
<em>&ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?&rdquo;</em> Yes. I lost track of them too.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t try. I do. But <strong>my brain doesn’t follow the rules.</strong></p>
<p>And yet… <strong>I still get things done.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-i-actually-get-work-done"><strong>How I Actually Get Work Done</strong></h2>
<p>I stopped looking for <strong>one perfect system</strong>—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of <strong>simple tricks and mental hacks</strong> to keep myself productive.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One task at a time.</strong> Multitasking? <strong>I quit that.</strong> If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing <strong>nothing</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Writing everything down.</strong> My memory is unreliable, so I put <strong>everything</strong> in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it.</li>
<li><strong>The Two-Minute Rule.</strong> If something takes <strong>less than two minutes</strong>, I do it <strong>right away</strong>. Otherwise, it disappears into <em>“I’ll do it later”</em> (which means never).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple timers.</strong> Since I forget I set a timer, I use <strong>two or three different ones</strong>. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer!</li>
<li><strong>Using my deep focus.</strong> When my brain decides something is <strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD</strong>, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the most important thing?</p>
<h3 id="i-work-with-my-brain-not-against-it"><strong>I Work With My Brain, Not Against It</strong></h3>
<p>I stopped trying to use <strong>systems made for other people</strong>. I can’t <strong>force</strong> focus, but I can <strong>catch it</strong> when it happens.</p>
<p>If I suddenly get <strong>super focused</strong> on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I <strong>write them all down</strong> and organize them later.</p>
<p>My productivity is not <strong>straightforward</strong>. <strong>It moves in all directions.</strong> And that’s okay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-tools-that-sometimes-help"><strong>The Tools That (Sometimes) Help</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notion:</strong> My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion.</li>
<li><strong>Post-it Notes:</strong> Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Timers (Lots of Them):</strong> On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. <em>At least one might help me.</em></li>
<li><strong>Single-tasking mode:</strong> <strong>One window. One tab. One job.</strong> If I open a second tab, it means <strong>I need to do it later.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Solid Starts:</strong> Yes, even for feeding my son. Because <strong>focus problems don’t take a break</strong> when you’re a parent.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, my brain is <strong>chaotic</strong>. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have <strong>a small collection of abandoned productivity tools</strong>.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day? <strong>I get things done.</strong></p>
<p>Not in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in <strong>my way.</strong></p>
<p>Because sometimes, <strong>thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.</strong></p>
<p>So if you ever see me <strong>staring at the screen</strong>, just know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I might be solving a <strong>complicated problem</strong>&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, <strong>I’ll figure it out.</strong></p>

      <title>The Browser Wars: My Exhausting Journey to Finding the Least Annoying Setup</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/browser-wars-journey-to-least-annoying-setup/</link>

      <description>Choosing a browser shouldn&amp;#39;t be this hard. From Safari’s WebKit prison to Windows’ Chromium clones, here’s my exhausting browser journey.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a software developer. I build things for the web. I write code.<br>
I understand how browsers work.</p>
<p>And yet, somehow, <strong>choosing a default browser nearly broke me.</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. <strong>It’s just a browser.</strong><br>
A glorified <strong>tab holder</strong>. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.</p>
<p>But the moment I tried to pick <em>the one</em>—<strong>the browser that would rule them all</strong>—I descended into <strong>a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="round-1-the-iphone-problem-or-apples-webkit-prison"><strong>Round 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison)</strong></h2>
<p>I thought I had a choice.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>I believed I could just <strong>install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone</strong> and live a normal life.</p>
<p>What a fool I was.</p>
<p>Because Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you <strong>use</strong> a real browser on iOS.<br>
No matter what I install—<strong>Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels</strong>—they’re <strong>all WebKit underneath.</strong></p>
<p>Which means every browser on iPhone is just <strong>Safari wearing a cheap disguise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chrome?</strong> Safari with Google Sync.</li>
<li><strong>Firefox?</strong> Safari with different branding.</li>
<li><strong>Brave?</strong> Safari with a tinfoil hat.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no escape. Safari is the law.</p>
<p>I tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, <strong>convincing myself it was different.</strong><br>
It wasn’t.</p>
<p>The pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.<br>
The only difference? <strong>A Google logo and more tracking.</strong></p>
<p>At some point, I accepted my fate. <strong>If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.</strong></p>
<p>Fine. <strong>Safari wins on iPhone.</strong><br>
Not because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a <strong>slow, battery-draining death.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="round-2-the-windows-browser-crisis-or-where-every-browser-is-the-same-anyway"><strong>Round 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway)</strong></h2>
<p>On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. <strong>Freedom.</strong></p>
<p>Or so I thought.</p>
<p>In reality, <strong>every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chrome</strong> – The original Chromium overlord. <strong>Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport</strong> and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist.</li>
<li><strong>Brave</strong> – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. <strong>Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vivaldi</strong> – For people who think <strong>customizing a browser is a personality trait.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Opera</strong> – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? <strong>Reveal yourselves.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Firefox</strong> – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. <strong>But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off</strong>, and the font rendering gives me trust issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I realized something horrifying.</p>
<p><strong>Every time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.</strong></p>
<p>Not because I <em>wanted</em> to, but because <strong>the entire web is optimized for Chromium.</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that <strong>the slightly-off fonts were a feature.</strong><br>
But in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an <strong>alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.</strong></p>
<p>So, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use <strong>the version that’s optimized for Windows</strong> and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.</p>
<p>And that’s how <strong>Edge won by default.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="round-3-the-syncing-nightmare-or-how-i-glued-this-mess-together"><strong>Round 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together)</strong></h2>
<p>So now I had:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safari on iPhone</strong> (<em>because Apple won’t let me have nice things</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Edge on Windows</strong> (<em>because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But now came the <strong>real</strong> problem.</p>
<p><strong>How do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google wants me to <strong>use Chrome on everything</strong> like some kind of cross-platform cult.</li>
<li>Apple wants me to <strong>use Safari on everything</strong> because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone.</li>
<li>Microsoft wants me to <strong>embrace Edge fully</strong> and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I refused to let any of them win.</p>
<p>So I <strong>hacked my way out</strong> with <strong>iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now <strong>Safari and Edge share bookmarks</strong> like two kids forced to get along.</li>
<li>I don’t need Google.</li>
<li>I don’t need third-party syncing tools.</li>
<li>And best of all, <strong>I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-the-browser-wars-were-a-lie"><strong>Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie</strong></h2>
<p>After all this research, testing, and <strong>questioning my life choices</strong>, I have one conclusion:</p>
<p><strong>All browsers are terrible.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some track you aggressively.</li>
<li>Some drain your battery.</li>
<li>Some crash randomly.</li>
<li>Some make you feel guilty for using them.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in the end? <strong>A browser is just a tool.</strong></p>
<p>The best one is <strong>the one that gets in your way the least.</strong></p>
<p>For me, that means:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Safari on iPhone</strong> (<em>because fighting Apple is exhausting</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>Edge on Windows</strong> (<em>because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>iCloud Sync</strong> (<em>because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks</em>).</p>
<p>Is it perfect? No.<br>
Is it better than switching browsers every week? <strong>Yes.</strong><br>
Will I probably change my mind in six months? <strong>Also yes.</strong></p>
<p>Because let’s be real—<strong>the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.</strong></p>

      <description>Change isn&amp;#39;t about willpower—it&amp;#39;s about identity. Discover why habits fail and how shifting your identity leads to lasting change.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works"><strong>Why We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)</strong></h1>
<p>I used to think change was about willpower.</p>
<p>If I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder. Push through resistance. Be disciplined.</p>
<p>I told myself, <em>“Just do it. No excuses.”</em></p>
<p>And for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.</p>
<p>But then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.</p>
<p>And every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.</p>
<p>Then I learned something that changed everything:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why"><strong>Why &ldquo;Trying Harder&rdquo; Never Works</strong></h2>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<p>Two people are offered a cigarette.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first person says, <em>“No thanks, I’m trying to quit.”</em></li>
<li>The second person says, <em>“No thanks, I don’t smoke.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first person is using willpower—constantly resisting.</li>
<li>The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why most habits fail.</p>
<p>We focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-identity-based-approach-to-change"><strong>The Identity-Based Approach to Change</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.</p>
<p>Every action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person.</li>
<li>If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer.</li>
<li>If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to stop seeing habits as things I <em>do</em> and start seeing them as things that define who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-im-rewiring-my-brain-for-lasting-change"><strong>How I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change</strong></h2>
<p>I started with small identity shifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of <em>“I should exercise more,”</em> I tell myself <em>“I’m the kind of person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to focus better,”</em> I remind myself <em>“I’m someone who works with deep focus.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to stop procrastinating,”</em> I say <em>“I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:</p>
<p><strong>The brain hates cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>
<p>When you tell yourself you <em>are</em> something, you subconsciously start acting like it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day.</li>
<li>If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes.</li>
<li>If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-trying-and-being"><strong>The Difference Between Trying and Being</strong></h2>
<p>I used to say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m trying to exercise more.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to focus better.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to wake up earlier.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now I say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m a person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m someone who works with focus.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m the kind of person who gets up early.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.</p>
<p>And identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Willpower is unreliable.<br>
Motivation fades.<br>
But identity sticks.</p>
<p>If you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.<br>
Start with who you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to read more? Become a reader.</li>
<li>Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health.</li>
<li>Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the truth is:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.</strong></p>
<p>Change who you are, and the actions will follow.</p>

      <title>The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck</title>

      <description>Motivation is a lie. Discover why waiting to feel inspired keeps you stuck and learn practical strategies to take action anyway.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck"><strong>The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I waited for <strong>motivation to strike</strong>.</p>
<p>I thought <strong>productive people</strong> had some kind of <strong>magical drive</strong> I didn’t.<br>
That one day, I’d wake up <strong>full of energy</strong>, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects <strong>without procrastinating</strong>.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>That day <strong>never came.</strong></p>
<p>And it never <em>will.</em></p>
<p>Because here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-lie"><strong>Motivation is a lie.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-motivation-doesnt-matter"><strong>Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve all said it:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I just need to get motivated.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ll start when I feel ready.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I don’t have the energy today.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But <strong>motivation isn’t something you <em>have</em>—it’s something you <em>create.</em></strong></p>
<p>We think <strong>action comes after motivation</strong>, when really, it’s the other way around.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-follows-action-not-the-other-way-around"><strong>Motivation follows action, not the other way around.</strong></h3>
<p>You don’t <strong>wait to feel inspired</strong> before starting.<br>
You start, and then <strong>inspiration finds you.</strong></p>
<p>Once I figured this out, <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<p>I used to wait for that <strong>perfect wave of motivation</strong>—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something:</p>
<h3 id="i-always-felt-more-motivated-after-i-started-not-before"><strong>I always felt more motivated after I started, not before.</strong></h3>
<p>Even if I <em>didn’t feel like it</em>—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.<br>
That’s when I realized:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-side-effect-of-action"><strong>Motivation is a side effect of action.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-actually-works-and-why-its-so-simple"><strong>What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple)</strong></h2>
<p>If I waited to <em>feel</em> motivated, I’d never do anything.</p>
<p>So instead, I follow <strong>three simple rules</strong> that make action inevitable:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-the-5-minute-rule"><strong>1. The 5-Minute Rule</strong></h3>
<p>If something feels overwhelming, I <strong>trick my brain</strong> by saying:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I’ll just do it for five minutes.</strong> That’s it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too tired to work out?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of exercise.</em></li>
<li><strong>Don’t want to start that project?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of brainstorming.</em></li>
<li><strong>Can’t focus on writing?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of bad first drafts.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>90% of the time, I keep going.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>starting is the hardest part.</strong> Once I’m in motion, <strong>momentum keeps me moving.</strong></p>
<p>And if I really <strong>do stop after five minutes?</strong><br>
At least I did <em>something</em>—and something is infinitely <strong>better than nothing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-no-emotion-rule"><strong>2. The “No Emotion” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>I stopped asking myself <strong>if I <em>felt</em> like doing something.</strong></p>
<p>Feelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d <strong>never get anything done.</strong></p>
<p>So I stopped negotiating with myself.</p>
<p>Now, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. <strong>No debates. No negotiations.</strong><br>
It’s just <strong>what I do.</strong></p>
<p>✔ <strong>Exercise?</strong> → <em>It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Writing?</strong> → <em>Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Starting work?</strong> → <em>Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Action first. Feelings later.</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly, <strong>once I start, motivation usually shows up.</strong></p>
<p>And if it doesn’t? <strong>Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-3-choice-trick"><strong>3. The 3-Choice Trick</strong></h3>
<p>When I don’t want to do something, I <strong>limit my options</strong> to just three:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>Do it now.</strong> (<em>Just start, even if it’s imperfect.</em>)<br>
2️⃣ <strong>Do it badly.</strong> (<em>Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.</em>)<br>
3️⃣ <strong>Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.</strong></p>
<p>Turns out, <strong>staring at a wall is boring.</strong> So I usually just do the thing.</p>
<p>This trick works because it eliminates <strong>all distractions</strong>.<br>
I’m not allowed to <strong>scroll on my phone</strong> or <strong>check social media</strong>.</p>
<p>My only choices?<br>
✔ <strong>Work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Do it badly.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-works-the-science-of-momentum"><strong>Why This Works: The Science of Momentum</strong></h2>
<p>Newton’s First Law of Motion states:</p>
<h3 id="an-object-at-rest-stays-at-rest-and-an-object-in-motion-stays-in-motion"><strong>“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.”</strong></h3>
<p>Turns out, <strong>this applies to humans too.</strong></p>
<p>When we’re at rest (<strong>not doing the thing</strong>), it feels <strong>impossible to get moving</strong>.<br>
But <strong>once we start</strong>, it’s <strong>easier to keep going.</strong></p>
<p>This is why the hardest part of any task is <strong>getting started.</strong><br>
It’s why the <strong>5-minute rule works so well</strong>.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>It breaks the inertia.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It removes overthinking.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It makes starting feel effortless.</strong></p>
<p>And once you’re moving? <strong>Momentum takes over.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about willpower.<br>
It’s about <strong>tricking your brain into motion.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-trap-its-not-coming-to-save-you"><strong>Motivation is a trap.</strong> It’s not coming to save you.</h3>
<p>If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.<br>
If you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.</p>
<p>But action? <strong>Action leads to momentum.</strong><br>
And <strong>momentum creates motivation.</strong></p>
<p>So next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Start for five minutes.</strong> (<em>Even if it’s terrible.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Do it without debating.</strong> (<em>Feelings can catch up later.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Give yourself only three choices.</strong> (<em>Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.</em>)</p>
<p>Because once you start, you <em>won’t</em> stop.</p>
<p>And when you stop needing motivation to begin, <strong>you’ll get more done than ever before.</strong></p>

      <title>Why Changing Your Mind is a Sign of Intelligence, Not Weakness</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/</link>

      <description>Changing your mind isn’t a weakness—it’s growth. Discover why evolving your perspective makes you smarter and more adaptable.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people think <strong>changing your mind is a weakness</strong>—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That <strong>certainty equals strength</strong> and doubt makes you unreliable.</p>
<p>I <strong>completely disagree.</strong></p>
<p>I change my mind <strong>all the time.</strong> Not because I’m indecisive, but because <strong>I’m learning.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-art-of-arguing-with-yourself"><strong>The Art of Arguing With Yourself</strong></h2>
<p>It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, <strong>your brain worked hard to form it.</strong></p>
<p>And then, suddenly&hellip; doubt creeps in.</p>
<p>You start thinking about the <strong>opposite perspective.</strong> You challenge your own logic. You realize, <em>maybe I was missing something.</em></p>
<p>Some people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: <strong>every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve realized that my opinions are just <strong>snapshots</strong> of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need <strong>updates.</strong></p>
<p>I constantly ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What if I’m wrong?</em></li>
<li><em>What am I not considering?</em></li>
<li><em>How would someone who disagrees with me see this?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I argue <strong>against my own beliefs</strong> to test their strength. I look for <strong>holes in my logic.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t being indecisive. <strong>This is debugging my own thinking.</strong></p>
<p>And every time I find a flaw, I fix it. <strong>I upgrade.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="marriage-the-ultimate-debate-club"><strong>Marriage: The Ultimate Debate Club</strong></h2>
<p>If you want practice in <strong>changing your mind</strong>, get married.</p>
<p>My wife and I <strong>love</strong> to debate. Not argue—debate.</p>
<p>It starts with small things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is this really the best way to load the dishwasher?</em></li>
<li><em>Is a hot dog a sandwich?</em></li>
<li><em>Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, two hours later, we’re deep into <strong>life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.</strong></p>
<p>And sometimes, <strong>we completely switch sides.</strong></p>
<p>Not because one of us &ldquo;won.&rdquo;<br>
Not because we’re trying to be &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But because we actually <strong>listened</strong> to each other.</p>
<p>Because <strong>seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.</strong></p>
<p>And yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.<br>
(Okay, <strong>often</strong> she’s right, but that’s another story.)</p>
<p>But every time I admit I was wrong, <strong>I get smarter.</strong><br>
And every time she does, <strong>we both grow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-changing-your-mind-is-a-superpower"><strong>Why Changing Your Mind is a Superpower</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you never change your mind, <strong>you’re not learning.</strong> You’re just repeating yourself.</li>
<li>Admitting you were wrong <strong>doesn’t make you weak.</strong> It makes you someone people actually trust.</li>
<li>The smartest people <strong>aren’t the ones who refuse to budge.</strong> They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<p>Every time you change your mind, it means <strong>you’ve learned something new.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science evolves</strong> by questioning and updating its ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Great leaders</strong> adjust their strategies when new information comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Successful people</strong> don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing your mind <strong>doesn’t mean you were stupid before.</strong><br>
It means you’re <strong>smarter now.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t mean you were wrong.<br>
It means <strong>you’ve improved.</strong></p>
<p>And over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles <strong>the truth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="version-20-and-beyond"><strong>Version 2.0 (And Beyond)</strong></h2>
<p>I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.<br>
Now, I see it as <strong>a sign of growth.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to be <strong>version 1.0 of myself forever.</strong><br>
I want to be <strong>2.0, 3.0, 10.0</strong>—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.</p>
<p>Some people are <strong>proud of being &ldquo;consistent.&rdquo;</strong> But if you’re consistent <strong>just for the sake of consistency</strong>, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.</p>
<p>People who never change their minds? <strong>They’re frozen in time.</strong><br>
People who adapt, question, and rethink? <strong>They’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>And that means being willing to say,<br>
<em>&ldquo;I was wrong.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I learned something new.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It means embracing <strong>doubt, curiosity, and growth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>People think strength is about <strong>sticking to your guns no matter what.</strong><br>
But real strength? <strong>Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being <strong>curious</strong> enough to question yourself.</li>
<li>Being <strong>humble</strong> enough to admit when you’re wrong.</li>
<li>Being <strong>smart</strong> enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next time someone accuses you of <strong>flip-flopping</strong>, don’t take it as an insult.<br>
Take it as <strong>proof that you’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>Because the strongest minds?<br>
They’re the ones that <strong>never stop upgrading.</strong></p>

      <description>Tired all the time? It’s not just about sleep. Discover the 5 types of exhaustion and how to truly recharge.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep"><strong>Why You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)</strong></h1>
<p>For the longest time, I thought I was just <em>tired.</em></p>
<p>Not enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time. Classic exhaustion, right?</p>
<p>So I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.</p>
<p>But no matter what I did, the fatigue <strong>never went away.</strong></p>
<p>I blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, <em>&ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Then I realized something.</p>
<p>I wasn’t just <strong>physically</strong> exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.</p>
<p>And no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.</p>
<p>Because <strong>we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-5-types-of-exhaustion-and-why-we-ignore-them"><strong>The 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them)</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1-mental-exhaustion-the-overloaded-brain"><strong>1. Mental Exhaustion</strong> (<em>The Overloaded Brain</em>)</h3>
<p>Too many tabs open (in your browser <em>and</em> your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-emotional-exhaustion-the-feeling-drain"><strong>2. Emotional Exhaustion</strong> (<em>The Feeling Drain</em>)</h3>
<p>When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-creative-exhaustion-the-empty-tank"><strong>3. Creative Exhaustion</strong> (<em>The Empty Tank</em>)</h3>
<p>The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in &lsquo;output mode&rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-social-exhaustion-the-people-drain"><strong>4. Social Exhaustion</strong> (<em>The People Drain</em>)</h3>
<p>It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-sensory-exhaustion-the-overstimulation-overload"><strong>5. Sensory Exhaustion</strong> (<em>The Overstimulation Overload</em>)</h3>
<p>Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it <strong>never shuts up.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-we-stay-exhausted-even-when-we-rest"><strong>Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest)</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s the problem: <strong>we treat them all the same way.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mental exhaustion?</strong> We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional exhaustion?</strong> We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them.</li>
<li><strong>Creative exhaustion?</strong> We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it.</li>
<li><strong>Social exhaustion?</strong> We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Sensory exhaustion?</strong> We &ldquo;relax&rdquo; by staring at another screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.</p>
<p>But if you don’t know <em>what kind</em> of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-heres-how-im-fixing-it"><strong>So Here’s How I’m Fixing It</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of &ldquo;resting&rdquo; in a generic way, I’m <strong>resting with purpose.</strong></p>
<p>I match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-mental-exhaustion--give-your-brain-a-reset"><strong>1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep work in short bursts</strong> – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching.</li>
<li><strong>Digital decluttering</strong> – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling.</li>
<li><strong>Brain dump journaling</strong> – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-emotional-exhaustion--reduce-decision-fatigue"><strong>2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fewer choices</strong> – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional boundaries</strong> – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Journaling</strong> – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-creative-exhaustion--refuel-your-inspiration"><strong>3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consume good input</strong> – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things.</li>
<li><strong>Change of scenery</strong> – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Play</strong> – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-social-exhaustion--intentional-solitude"><strong>4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaningful connections only</strong> – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled alone time</strong> – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Boundaries</strong> – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="5-sensory-exhaustion--turn-down-the-noise"><strong>5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital detox</strong> – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode.</li>
<li><strong>Minimalist workspace</strong> – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload.</li>
<li><strong>Silence and darkness</strong> – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about <em>not sleeping enough.</em></p>
<p>But the real question isn’t <strong>&ldquo;Am I tired?&rdquo;</strong>—it’s <strong>&ldquo;What kind of tired am I?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Once you figure that out?<br>
You can finally start <strong>recharging the right way.</strong></p>
<p>And you might just find that you’re not broken.<br>
You were just <strong>resting wrong.</strong></p>

      <title>Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)</title>

      <description>We often think the past was better, but nostalgia tricks us. Discover why we romanticize the past and how to appreciate the present.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck"><strong>Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)</strong></h1>
<p>Ever caught yourself thinking, <em>“Things were better back then”</em>?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just <em>felt</em> different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.</p>
<p>I do this all the time.</p>
<p>I think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.<br>
I remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being <em>disconnected.</em></p>
<p>And then, reality hits me: <strong>the past wasn’t actually better. It just feels that way.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-nostalgia-filter-why-we-rewrite-our-own-history"><strong>The Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History</strong></h2>
<p>Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They <strong>edit, distort, and reshape</strong> them over time. And they’re <em>really</em> good at two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Blurring the bad parts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments.</li>
<li>The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel.</li>
<li>It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intensifying emotions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified.</li>
<li>The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt <em>magical.</em></li>
<li>We remember how we <em>felt</em>, not necessarily how things <em>were.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, <em>“They don’t make movies like they used to.”</em></p>
<p>It’s not that things were better. <strong>It’s that we experienced them differently.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-we-crave-the-past-and-how-it-tricks-us"><strong>Why We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us)</strong></h2>
<p>So why do we keep looking back?</p>
<p>Because nostalgia is <strong>a safe place</strong>—one where we already know how everything turns out.</p>
<p>And when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:</p>
<p>They make the past feel <strong>simpler, warmer, and more certain</strong> than it actually was.</p>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ‘90s?</strong><br>
We remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls.</li>
<li><strong>Childhood?</strong><br>
We remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster.</li>
<li><strong>Early relationships?</strong><br>
We remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.<br>
But I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.</p>
<p>My brain <strong>edited those parts out.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-double-edged-sword-of-nostalgia"><strong>The Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia</strong></h2>
<p>Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be <strong>beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.</strong><br>
But it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.</p>
<p>When we convince ourselves that the past was better, we <strong>rob the present of its potential.</strong></p>
<p>We start thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Things will never be as good as they were.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I was happier back then.”</em></li>
<li><em>“The world is worse now.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But was it really better?<br>
Or did we just experience it <strong>differently</strong>?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so"><strong>So&hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past?</strong></h2>
<p>Not at all. Nostalgia is <strong>a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I see it now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What made those times feel special?</li>
<li>Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure?</li>
<li>Maybe I need <em>more</em> of that in my life today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it.</li>
<li>If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about <strong>creation and purpose.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of comparing, I create.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today.</li>
<li>The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a <strong>mirror</strong>—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.</p>
<p>It’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.<br>
It came from <strong>how we experienced it.</strong></p>
<p>We were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.</p>
<p>So next time you find yourself saying, <em>“Things were better back then”</em>, stop and ask:</p>
<p><em>Or maybe&hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?</em></p>
<p>Maybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how <strong>distracted, rushed, and stressed</strong> we’ve become.</p>
<p>Maybe the best days aren’t behind us.<br>
<strong>Maybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.</strong></p>

      <title>The Best Everyday Backpack? My Never-Ending Search for the Perfect One</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/best-everyday-backpack-never-ending-search/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/best-everyday-backpack-never-ending-search/</guid>
      <description>The quest for the perfect backpack feels like an endless life mission. From too many pockets to uncomfortable straps, the search continues.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know why, but finding the right backpack feels like <strong>a life quest</strong>—like I’m a video game character on an <strong>endless side mission</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve owned <strong>plenty of backpacks</strong>. But none of them have ever been <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>There’s always <em>something</em> off.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Too big. Too small.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Too many pockets. Not enough pockets.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Feels great when empty. Turns into a brick when full.</strong></p>
<p>And yet, <strong>the search continues</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-backpack-goldilocks-zone"><strong>The Backpack Goldilocks Zone</strong></h2>
<p>I know what I want—at least, in theory.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Compact but spacious</strong> – Big enough for a water bottle, light jacket, emergency battery, and some snacks. But not so big that I look like I’m about to hike the Appalachian Trail.<br>
✔ <strong>Lightweight but durable</strong> – Because I don’t want to feel like I’m carrying bricks, but I also don’t want it falling apart in six months.<br>
✔ <strong>Minimalist but functional</strong> – Clean design. No excessive straps, no giant logos, no 42 different compartments for things I’ll forget I even packed.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, right?</p>
<p>You’d think so.</p>
<p>But every time I think I’ve found <strong>“the one”</strong>, it ends up being&hellip; <strong>not quite right.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s either <strong>too bulky</strong> when half-empty or <strong>too tight</strong> when fully loaded.</li>
<li>It looks perfect <strong>online</strong> but feels terrible <strong>in real life</strong>.</li>
<li>It’s either an <strong>endless black hole</strong> or a <strong>maze of tiny compartments that make me question my own memory</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not asking for a <strong>magic bag of holding</strong>.<br>
Just a <strong>backpack that actually fits my daily life</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-backpacks-that-have-let-me-down"><strong>The Backpacks That Have Let Me Down</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve tried them all.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-looks-perfect-but-feels-terrible-backpack"><strong>1. The “Looks Perfect But Feels Terrible” Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve been betrayed by backpacks that <em>seem</em> like <strong>the one</strong>, only to realize:</p>
<ul>
<li>The straps <strong>dig into my shoulders like tiny instruments of torture</strong>.</li>
<li>The padding looks comfortable, but after an hour of walking, <strong>my shoulders are on fire</strong>.</li>
<li>Even the most &ldquo;ergonomic&rdquo; designs somehow turn into <strong>medieval punishment devices</strong> when I’m rushing through NYC.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-the-endless-black-hole-backpack"><strong>2. The “Endless Black Hole” Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>You know the kind. <strong>No organization, just one giant pocket</strong> where everything disappears.</p>
<p>Want your keys? Hope you enjoy <strong>an archaeological dig</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s always the same scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m in a rush.</li>
<li>The thing I need is <strong>somewhere</strong> at the bottom.</li>
<li>I dig through <strong>tangled charging cables, crumpled receipts, and a water bottle that somehow went horizontal</strong>.</li>
<li>By the time I find my keys, I’m questioning <strong>every decision that led me to this moment</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-the-too-many-compartments-backpack"><strong>3. The “Too Many Compartments” Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>At first, it seems genius. A <strong>special pocket for everything!</strong></p>
<p>Then, a month later, I can’t remember where <em>anything</em> is.</p>
<p>It’s a <strong>scavenger hunt</strong> every time I need my headphones.</p>
<p>There’s a pocket for my phone, a <strong>secret compartment for my wallet</strong>, a tiny slot for pens, and another one&hellip; for&hellip; <strong>what was that even for?</strong></p>
<p>The more <strong>organized</strong> it tries to be, the more <strong>chaotic</strong> my life becomes.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-why-is-this-so-heavy-backpack"><strong>4. The “Why Is This So Heavy?!” Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>Empty, it <strong>already</strong> feels like I’m carrying bricks.</p>
<p>Add a laptop and a water bottle, and suddenly I need <strong>physical therapy</strong>.</p>
<p>I try to be a <strong>minimalist</strong>, but the backpack itself <strong>sabotages me</strong>.</p>
<p>Now I <strong>check product descriptions</strong> for the <strong>empty weight</strong> before even considering a purchase.</p>
<p>If it feels heavy in the store, <strong>it’s already dead to me</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-do-i-even-care-this-much"><strong>Why Do I Even Care This Much?</strong></h2>
<p>I know this sounds <strong>ridiculous</strong>.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It’s just a backpack, right?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>But here’s the thing:</p>
<p>A backpack is <strong>a daily companion</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s with you through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long walks.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Commutes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unexpected errands.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Last-minute snack storage emergencies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>right</em> one makes life <strong>easier</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>wrong</em> one? <strong>An endless source of frustration</strong>.</p>
<p>And when you live in <strong>New York</strong>, where you’re <strong>constantly moving</strong>, your backpack is <strong>an extension of yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m <strong>walking miles every day</strong>.<br>
I’m <strong>squeezing into crowded subway cars</strong>.<br>
I’m <strong>weaving through tourist mobs in Times Square</strong>.</p>
<p>I need a backpack that <strong>moves with me</strong>—not <strong>against me</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to <strong>forget</strong> it’s even there, not <strong>curse its existence</strong> every time I try to get my MetroCard.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-minimalists-dilemma"><strong>The Minimalist’s Dilemma</strong></h2>
<p>I’m not just looking for a backpack.</p>
<p>I’m looking for <strong>the one.</strong><br>
The <strong>last backpack I’ll ever need</strong>.</p>
<p>I love <strong>minimalism</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m on a mission to find:<br>
✔ <strong>One perfect item</strong> for every category in my life.<br>
✔ <strong>One pen. One jacket. One bag.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>No backups. No alternatives. Just the best version of everything I use.</strong></p>
<p>So when it comes to a backpack, it’s not just about <strong>functionality</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>perfection.</strong></p>
<p>Because if I find <strong>the right one</strong>, I’ll <strong>never</strong> have to think about backpacks again.</p>
<p>But that’s the problem, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>I keep thinking about backpacks.</strong><br>
I keep <strong>testing, trying, and switching</strong>.</p>
<p>Because <strong>none of them have been “the one.”</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="will-i-ever-find-the-one"><strong>Will I Ever Find “The One”?</strong></h2>
<p>I’d love to say I’ve <strong>finally found my perfect backpack</strong>, but let’s be real—<strong>this is an ongoing saga.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe <strong>the</strong> backpack is out there, waiting for me to discover it.</li>
<li>Maybe it doesn’t exist, and I’ll just cycle through <strong>20 more before giving up</strong>.</li>
<li>Maybe, like some kind of <strong>minimalist curse</strong>, I’m doomed to be haunted by this search forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe…</p>
<p>Just maybe…</p>
<p><strong>The real perfect backpack was the friends we made along the way.</strong></p>
<p>(But also, if you have any recommendations, <em>please</em> let me know. The search continues.)</p>
