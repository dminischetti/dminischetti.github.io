More efficiency. More checkboxes. If I wasn’t constantly optimizing, planning, and squeezing every second for maximum output, I was failing.\nAnd at first, it worked. I was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine. But then something strange happened.\nDespite all my “productivity,” I felt like I was going nowhere.\nI was busy, but not fulfilled.\nEfficient, but not effective.\nAlways working, but never actually moving forward.\nAnd that’s when I realized: The way we think about productivity is broken.\nThe False Promise of “Getting More Done” Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a lie: that the key to success is efficiency. That if we could just optimize our time perfectly, automate enough tasks, and use the right productivity tools, we’d finally get ahead.\nBut here’s the truth: Productivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the right things done.\nAnd if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\nYou feel overwhelmed. You have too much to do, and not enough time. You try to optimize. You start using time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day. You get efficient… at the wrong things. You’re answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, and organizing your tasks better—but none of it is actually making a difference. You stay stuck in a loop of busyness. You’re always “doing,” but never really progressing. This is the scary part: Productivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion.\nAnd that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.\nI was checking boxes but not moving forward. I was working hard but not working smart. I was busy—but not productive.\nThe Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition I used to ask myself, “How can I fit more into my day?”\nNow, I ask a better question:\n“What can I remove?”\nReal productivity isn’t about adding more tasks. It’s about eliminating distractions, cutting useless work, and focusing on what actually moves the needle.\nHere’s how I flipped my mindset:\n1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours fine-tuning my task manager, tweaking my schedule, and perfecting my workflow. It felt productive—but in reality, it was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\nI realized that optimizing the unimportant is just another way to procrastinate. It feels productive but gets you nowhere.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort. But most of us spend our time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking, “How can I do more?” I ask:\nWhat’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact? What can I cut without any real consequence? Then, I focus ruthlessly on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking. But I’ve learned that multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time. And for a developer, that’s a productivity killer.\nNow, I do the opposite:\nOne tab at a time. No distractions. One task at a time. Full focus, deep work. One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth. It feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\nI get more done in less time, and the quality of my work is better. It turns out, single-tasking is the real superpower.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort. They spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\nDo fewer things, but do them exceptionally well. Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals. Focus on quality over quantity. Ironically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\nHow much progress I make on things that actually matter. How much energy I have left at the end of the day. How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work. I stopped asking, “How can I do more?” and started asking, “How can I do less, but better?”\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\nInstead of doing more, do less—strategically. Instead of working harder, work on the right things. Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity. Because the truth is: The most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done. They’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret. It’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","wordCount":"889","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-01-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-03T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://minischetti.org/posts/the-productivity-myth-thats-keeping-you-stuck-and-how-to-escape-it/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dominic Minischetti","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://minischetti.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://minischetti.org/ accesskey=h title="Dominic Minischetti (Alt + H)">Dominic Minischetti</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/resume/ title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">The Productivity Myth That’s Keeping You Stuck (And How to Escape It)</h1><div class=post-description>Productivity isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing what matters.
