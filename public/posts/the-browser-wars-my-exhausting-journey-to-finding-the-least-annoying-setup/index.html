A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions.

Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months? Also yes.\nBecause let’s be real—the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.\n",

<li>Some track you aggressively.</li>
<li>Some drain your battery.</li>
<li>Some crash randomly.</li>
<li>Some make you feel guilty for using them.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in the end? <strong>A browser is just a tool.</strong></p>
<p>The best one is <strong>the one that gets in your way the least.</strong></p>
<p>For me, that means:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Safari on iPhone</strong> (<em>because fighting Apple is exhausting</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>Edge on Windows</strong> (<em>because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>iCloud Sync</strong> (<em>because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks</em>).</p>
<p>Is it perfect? No.<br>
Is it better than switching browsers every week? <strong>Yes.</strong><br>
Will I probably change my mind in six months? <strong>Also yes.</strong></p>
<p>Because let’s be real—<strong>the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.</strong></p>
