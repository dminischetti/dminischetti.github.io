More real. More exciting. More alive.\nI remember lazy afternoons in Italy, walking through narrow streets with no GPS, no constant notifications, just being present.\nI remember the smell of fresh bread from the corner bakery, the sound of the church bells, the faces of people who seemed to have all the time in the world.\nI think about the early days of the internet. The magic of waiting for a page to load. The thrill of discovering something new. The simplicity of logging off and actually being disconnected.\nAnd then, reality hits me: the past wasn’t actually better. It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reframe them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though you remember arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not because things were better. It’s because we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place.\nWhen life feels overwhelming, the past becomes a mental escape—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present is uncertain? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out. It turned a complicated reality into a beautiful memory.\nBut the reality is, nostalgia is a story we tell ourselves.\nAnd like any story, it leaves out the messy parts.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo… Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is beautiful—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that now. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some special ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.\nSo next time you find yourself saying, “Things were better back then”, stop and ask:\nOr maybe… I was just better at living in the moment?\nMaybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how distracted, rushed, and stressed we’ve become.\nMaybe the best days aren’t behind us.\nMaybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.\n","wordCount":"832","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-10-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-10-04T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://minischetti.org/posts/why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-its-a-trap/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dominic Minischetti","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://minischetti.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://minischetti.org/ accesskey=h title="Dominic Minischetti (Alt + H)">Dominic Minischetti</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/resume/ title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It’s a Trap)</h1><div class=post-description>We often think the past was better, but nostalgia tricks us.
