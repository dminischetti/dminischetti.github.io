  "articleBody": "The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck For years, I waited for motivation to strike.\nI thought productive people had some kind of magical drive I didn’t.\nThat one day, I’d wake up full of energy, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects without procrastinating.\nGuess what?\nThat day never came.\nAnd it never will.\nBecause here’s the truth:\nMotivation is a lie. Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n",

✔ <strong>Do it badly.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.</strong></p>

<h2 id="why-this-works-the-science-of-momentum"><strong>Why This Works: The Science of Momentum</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-this-works-the-science-of-momentum">#</a></h2>
<p>Newton’s First Law of Motion states:</p>
<h3 id="an-object-at-rest-stays-at-rest-and-an-object-in-motion-stays-in-motion"><strong>“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.”</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#an-object-at-rest-stays-at-rest-and-an-object-in-motion-stays-in-motion">#</a></h3>
<p>Turns out, <strong>this applies to humans too.</strong></p>
<p>When we’re at rest (<strong>not doing the thing</strong>), it feels <strong>impossible to get moving</strong>.<br>
But <strong>once we start</strong>, it’s <strong>easier to keep going.</strong></p>
<p>This is why the hardest part of any task is <strong>getting started.</strong><br>
It’s why the <strong>5-minute rule works so well</strong>.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>It breaks the inertia.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It removes overthinking.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It makes starting feel effortless.</strong></p>
<p>And once you’re moving? <strong>Momentum takes over.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about willpower.<br>
It’s about <strong>tricking your brain into motion.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-takeaway">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-trap-its-not-coming-to-save-you"><strong>Motivation is a trap.</strong> It’s not coming to save you.<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#motivation-is-a-trap-its-not-coming-to-save-you">#</a></h3>
<p>If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.<br>
If you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.</p>
<p>But action? <strong>Action leads to momentum.</strong><br>
And <strong>momentum creates motivation.</strong></p>
<p>So next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Start for five minutes.</strong> (<em>Even if it’s terrible.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Do it without debating.</strong> (<em>Feelings can catch up later.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Give yourself only three choices.</strong> (<em>Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.</em>)</p>
<p>Because once you start, you <em>won’t</em> stop.</p>
<p>And when you stop needing motivation to begin, <strong>you’ll get more done than ever before.</strong></p>
