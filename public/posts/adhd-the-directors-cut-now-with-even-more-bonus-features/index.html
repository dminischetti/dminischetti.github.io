There’s no pause button, no clear plot, and just when you think we’re getting somewhere, BAM—hard cut to a completely unrelated subplot.\nOne second, I’m working. Deep focus. Absolute flow. The kind of state productivity gurus dream about.\nThe next second? Oh, look, a fascinating article about how ancient Romans made concrete.\nWait, wasn’t I supposed to answer that email?\nOh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let’s do some research.\nWait. What was I doing?\nAnd just like that, I’ve time-traveled 30 minutes into the future, holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of a completely different task than the one I started.\nThe ADHD Productivity Toolbox: Every Method Ever Invented I’ve tried everything. Every. Single. System.\nPost-it Notes? Great, until my desk looks like a crime investigation board. Timers? Perfect, until I hyperfocus so hard that I forget I set them. To-do lists? Love them. Make them daily. Never look at them again. Apps? Oh, I collect productivity apps like Pokémon. I have at least five for tasks, two for time tracking, one for notes, and none of them actually help if I forget to open them. Pomodoro? Sure, except when I ignore the break and work for four hours straight because my brain suddenly decided this is the most important task in the universe. I’ve tried all the classic productivity advice:\n“Just prioritize better!” Sure, but they’re all priorities. “Why not use reminders?” Great idea. If only I remembered to set them. “Have you tried digital planners?” Yes. I lost track of them, too. It’s not that I don’t try. It’s that my brain doesn’t follow the rules.\nAnd yet… I still get things done.\nHow I Actually Make It Work Despite the chaos, I’ve found ways to outsmart my own brain. Not through one perfect system (because that doesn’t exist), but through a constantly shifting mix of tricks, hacks, and Jedi mind games.\nSingle-tasking like a rebel. Multitasking? I gave that up. If I try doing two things at once, I’ll end up doing neither. Now, it’s one task at a time, with a mental guard dog barking at distractions. Externalizing everything. My brain? Unreliable. My second brain? Post-its, Notion, alarms, and a series of carefully placed “HEY, DON’T FORGET THIS” notes that future me will either appreciate or resent. The Two-Minute Rule. If it takes less than two minutes, I do it immediately. Because if I don’t, it disappears into the void of “I’ll get to it later” (translation: it’s never happening). Timers, but with extra supervision. I set a timer and a backup timer. And sometimes, I ask someone to remind me that I even set a timer. Letting the hyperfocus work for me. If my brain decides something is THE TASK, I ride that wave for as long as it lasts. No questions asked. But most importantly?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to fit my brain into productivity systems that weren’t built for it. I realized that I can’t force focus, but I can capture it when it shows up.\nIf I’m hyperfocused on a task, I run with it—even if it wasn’t what I planned for the day. If my brain is bouncing between ten ideas, I capture them on paper, messy and unordered, and sort them out later.\nI’ve accepted that my productivity isn’t linear. It’s more like a zig-zagging roller coaster. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Work Notion: My digital brain dump. It’s chaotic, but everything goes there. If I forget where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but reliable. They’re everywhere. My desk, my monitor, my wallet. I leave notes to future me like breadcrumbs through a maze. Timers (Multiple): I have timers on my phone, my watch, and my laptop. I need all three because I will absolutely forget one of them is ticking. Single-tasking Mode: One tab. One window. One task. If I need a second tab, it means I need a second task slot later, not now. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because guess what? ADHD doesn’t take a break just because you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small museum of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I always get things done. It might not be linear, it might not be conventional, but it works.\nBecause here’s the thing about ADHD: it’s not just a challenge. It’s also a different way of thinking, a different way of solving problems, and—sometimes—the secret ingredient to finding solutions no one else sees.\nIt’s like having a superpower that you don’t always know how to control. But when you figure it out, even just for a moment, it’s incredible.\nSo if you ever see me staring into space, just know: I’m either solving a complex problem… or I just momentarily forgot what I was doing. Either way, I’ll figure it out.\n","wordCount":"860","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-11-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-11-29T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://minischetti.org/posts/adhd-the-directors-cut-now-with-even-more-bonus-features/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dominic Minischetti","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://minischetti.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://minischetti.org/ accesskey=h title="Dominic Minischetti (Alt + H)">Dominic Minischetti</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/resume/ title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">ADHD: The Director’s Cut (Now with Even More Bonus Features!)</h1><div class=post-description>Living with ADHD is like an action movie with no pause button.
