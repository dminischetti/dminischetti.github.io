A sudden cut to something completely different.\nOne moment, I’m focused, working hard. The next?\nOh wow, did you know ancient Romans made concrete that still exists today?\nWait, wasn’t I supposed to answer an email?\nOh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let me check…\nWait. What was I doing?\nAnd just like that, 30 minutes disappear. I’m holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of a completely different task than the one I started.\nThe Productivity Toolbox: Everything I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work) I’ve tested every productivity method I could find.\nPost-it Notes? Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board. Timers? Useful—if I remember I set them. To-do lists? I write them, I admire them… I never check them again. Productivity apps? I collect them like Pokémon. I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? None work if I forget to open them. Pomodoro? Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists. I’ve heard all the usual advice:\n“Just choose your priorities!” But everything feels important.\n“Use reminders!” Great idea—if I remember to set them.\n“Have you tried digital planners?” Yes. I lost track of them too.\nIt’s not that I don’t try. I do. But my brain doesn’t follow the rules.\nAnd yet… I still get things done.\nHow I Actually Get Work Done I stopped looking for one perfect system—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of simple tricks and mental hacks to keep myself productive.\nOne task at a time. Multitasking? I quit that. If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing nothing. Writing everything down. My memory is unreliable, so I put everything in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it. The Two-Minute Rule. If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned. But the most important thing?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to use systems made for other people. I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem… …or I might have forgotten what I was doing. Either way, I’ll figure it out.\n",
