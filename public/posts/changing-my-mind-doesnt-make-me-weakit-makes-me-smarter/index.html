That once you take a stance on something, you have to defend it forever. That certainty equals strength and doubt means you don’t know what you’re doing.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. And not because I’m indecisive—but because I’m evolving.\nThe Art of the Self-Debate It’s easy to believe your opinion is the right one. I mean, why wouldn’t it be? Your brain worked hard to form it. It makes sense. It feels correct.\nAnd then, a few moments later… a strange thing happens.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You question your own logic. You realize, wait, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed, defensive, or even ashamed. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to being right.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of my understanding at that moment. And just like outdated software, opinions need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I play devil’s advocate with myself. I argue against my own ideas, poke holes in my logic, and challenge my own beliefs.\nThis isn’t me being wishy-washy. This is me debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I update my mental software. I evolve.\nMarried Life: The Ultimate Debate Club If you ever need practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate. Our conversations start with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hotdog a sandwich? Should we rearrange the furniture… again? But soon, we’re deep into bigger questions about life, philosophy, and everything in between. Our ideas clash, we both present our cases, and sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nTwo hours later? We’re both better people than we were at the start of the conversation.\nBecause it’s not about winning. It’s about learning. It’s about seeing the world through someone else’s eyes. It’s about testing your own ideas and seeing if they hold up.\nAnd sometimes, they don’t. Sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit that I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I’m wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she admits she’s wrong, we both grow stronger.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning—you’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak—it makes you someone worth listening to. The smartest people aren’t the ones who defend their ideas at all costs—they’re the ones who refine their ideas constantly. Think about it: every time you change your mind, it means you’ve updated your thinking. You’ve gathered new information, considered a new angle, and sharpened your perspective.\nScience changes its mind all the time. That’s how it progresses. Great leaders adapt to new information instead of stubbornly clinging to outdated beliefs. Successful people don’t see changing their mind as failure—they see it as growth. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before. It means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong. It means you’ve learned something new.\nAnd over time? Your mind gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think changing my mind meant I was inconsistent or unreliable. Now, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI’m constantly debugging my beliefs. I’m constantly updating my worldview. I’m constantly learning.\nSome people are proud of how consistent they are. But if you’re consistent for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re just stuck in version 1.0 of themselves.\nBut the people who question, rethink, and adapt? They’re constantly evolving. Constantly improving.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 forever. I want to be version 2.0, 3.0, 10.0, and beyond. I want to grow, adapt, and keep learning.\nAnd that means being willing to say, “I was wrong.”\nIt means being willing to change my mind, even when it’s uncomfortable.\nIt means embracing doubt, questioning certainty, and seeing every debate as a chance to upgrade.\nThe Takeaway People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what. But real strength?\nReal strength is about knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about being curious enough to question your own beliefs.\nHumble enough to admit when you’re wrong.\nSmart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.\nSo next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.\nTake it as a sign that you’re upgrading.\nBecause the strongest minds aren’t the ones that never change.\nThey’re the ones that never stop evolving.\n","wordCount":"830","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-11-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-11-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://minischetti.org/posts/changing-my-mind-doesnt-make-me-weakit-makes-me-smarter/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dominic Minischetti","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://minischetti.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://minischetti.org/ accesskey=h title="Dominic Minischetti (Alt + H)">Dominic Minischetti</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/posts/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=https://minischetti.org/resume/ title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Changing My Mind Doesn’t Make Me Weak—It Makes Me Smarter</h1><div class=post-description>Changing your mind isn’t a weakness—it’s growth.
