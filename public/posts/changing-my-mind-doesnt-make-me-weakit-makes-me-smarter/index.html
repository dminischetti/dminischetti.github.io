That certainty equals strength and doubt makes you unreliable.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. Not because I’m indecisive, but because I’m learning.\nThe Art of Arguing With Yourself It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly… doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us “won.”\nNot because we’re trying to be “right.”\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being “consistent.” But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re frozen in time.\nPeople who adapt, question, and rethink? They’re evolving.\nAnd that means being willing to say,\n“I was wrong.”\n“I learned something new.”\n“I’ve updated my thinking.”\nIt means embracing doubt, curiosity, and growth.\nThe Takeaway People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what.\nBut real strength? Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about:\nBeing curious enough to question yourself. Being humble enough to admit when you’re wrong. Being smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth. So the next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.\nTake it as proof that you’re evolving.\nBecause the strongest minds?\nThey’re the ones that never stop upgrading.\n",

<p>It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, <strong>your brain worked hard to form it.</strong></p>
<p>And then, suddenly&hellip; doubt creeps in.</p>
<p>You start thinking about the <strong>opposite perspective.</strong> You challenge your own logic. You realize, <em>maybe I was missing something.</em></p>
<p>Some people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: <strong>every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve realized that my opinions are just <strong>snapshots</strong> of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need <strong>updates.</strong></p>

<p>If you want practice in <strong>changing your mind</strong>, get married.</p>
<p>My wife and I <strong>love</strong> to debate. Not argue—debate.</p>
<p>It starts with small things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is this really the best way to load the dishwasher?</em></li>
<li><em>Is a hot dog a sandwich?</em></li>
<li><em>Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, two hours later, we’re deep into <strong>life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.</strong></p>
<p>And sometimes, <strong>we completely switch sides.</strong></p>
<p>Not because one of us &ldquo;won.&rdquo;<br>
Not because we’re trying to be &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But because we actually <strong>listened</strong> to each other.</p>
<p>Because <strong>seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.</strong></p>
<p>And yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.<br>
(Okay, <strong>often</strong> she’s right, but that’s another story.)</p>
<p>But every time I admit I was wrong, <strong>I get smarter.</strong><br>
And every time she does, <strong>we both grow.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you never change your mind, <strong>you’re not learning.</strong> You’re just repeating yourself.</li>
<li>Admitting you were wrong <strong>doesn’t make you weak.</strong> It makes you someone people actually trust.</li>
<li>The smartest people <strong>aren’t the ones who refuse to budge.</strong> They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<p>Every time you change your mind, it means <strong>you’ve learned something new.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science evolves</strong> by questioning and updating its ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Great leaders</strong> adjust their strategies when new information comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Successful people</strong> don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing your mind <strong>doesn’t mean you were stupid before.</strong><br>
It means you’re <strong>smarter now.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t mean you were wrong.<br>
It means <strong>you’ve improved.</strong></p>
<p>And over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles <strong>the truth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="version-20-and-beyond"><strong>Version 2.0 (And Beyond)</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#version-20-and-beyond">#</a></h2>
<p>I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.<br>
Now, I see it as <strong>a sign of growth.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to be <strong>version 1.0 of myself forever.</strong><br>
I want to be <strong>2.0, 3.0, 10.0</strong>—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.</p>
<p>Some people are <strong>proud of being &ldquo;consistent.&rdquo;</strong> But if you’re consistent <strong>just for the sake of consistency</strong>, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.</p>
<p>People who never change their minds? <strong>They’re frozen in time.</strong><br>
People who adapt, question, and rethink? <strong>They’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>And that means being willing to say,<br>
<em>&ldquo;I was wrong.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I learned something new.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It means embracing <strong>doubt, curiosity, and growth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-takeaway">#</a></h2>
<p>People think strength is about <strong>sticking to your guns no matter what.</strong><br>
But real strength? <strong>Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being <strong>curious</strong> enough to question yourself.</li>
<li>Being <strong>humble</strong> enough to admit when you’re wrong.</li>
<li>Being <strong>smart</strong> enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next time someone accuses you of <strong>flip-flopping</strong>, don’t take it as an insult.<br>
Take it as <strong>proof that you’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>Because the strongest minds?<br>
They’re the ones that <strong>never stop upgrading.</strong></p>
