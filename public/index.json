[{"content":"My Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT I thought I was smart. I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.\nAnd slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:\nThis tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.\nHe Tasted the World — Literally Babies have 30,000 taste buds. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s three times more than adults.\nWhen my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if you could taste shapes, or feel sounds.\nSome researchers believe that babies might experience synesthesia early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally taste textures or feel sounds before those brain connections settle down.\nHonestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.\nHe Saw Things I’ll Never See Again At one point, my son could recognize every human face — no matter the ethnicity. Even monkeys. Yes, monkeys.\nBut then came perceptual narrowing: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, “We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”\nNow he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.\nFor a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.\nAnd we call adults smart?\nHe Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked vision and touch.\nThis is called peripersonal space awareness, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.\nBy eight months, babies expect sensory outcomes — and are surprised when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.\nThat’s if-then logic, built in.\nAnd unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.\nHe Could Hear Every Language on Earth Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones we don’t even speak.\nHindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.\nBut as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.\nThis is called phonetic narrowing. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.\nMeanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.\nHis Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t. There’s this old myth that babies lose the stepping reflex by 2 months. Not true.\nWhat actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.\nIn fact, one study showed that babies who \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the stepping reflex started doing it again… in water, where their legs were lighter.\nSo yes — my son had the walking software pre-installed, he was just waiting for the driver update.\nHe Knows If You\u0026rsquo;re a Good Person Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.\nThey even prefer nice puppets over mean ones. Without being told.\nThat’s proto-moral reasoning. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.\nIf my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.\nHe Does Math. The Impossible Kind. If you show a baby a simple math \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.\nThat’s because they know something’s off.\nIt’s called number sense.\nNo formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.\nIt’s basically unit testing for logic — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.\nBabbling = Precompiled Language When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.\nHe’s compiling syntax.\nStudies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will babble with their hands. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.\nSo language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about brains. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.\nHe’s not learning language. He’s already running the beta release.\nHis Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids Here’s what’s running during nap time:\nNeural pruning REM-driven memory consolidation Cortisol modulation Synaptic reorganization Night mode updates Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.\nIt’s unsupervised machine learning, every night.\nWhich is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.\nFinal Thoughts Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.\nBut none of it — none of it — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.\nHe’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.\nHe’s not just smart.\nHe’s smarter than ChatGPT.\nAnd when I ask him something…\nHe looks me in the eye…\n…and says: \u0026ldquo;Banana.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt\"\u003eMy Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was smart.

No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a Content Management System (CMS) feels like.\nI should know. I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.\nFor me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.\nSo, What Exactly Is a CMS? Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically the control center of a website. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content without touching a single line of code.\nThink of it like a kitchen. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.\nWithout a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. It’s not pretty.\nWhy Should You Care? Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).\nA painfully slow website (the kind that makes you question all your life choices). Articles impossible to find (why is the latest election update buried under \u0026ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil\u0026rdquo;?). A paywall that feels like a trap (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand). A good CMS, though? It keeps everything fast, smooth, and user-friendly. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists actually get paid.\nAnd that’s exactly what we do at BLOX Digital.\nWhy BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT) At BLOX Digital, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build the CMS platform.\nPowering 2,000+ news sites across the U.S. Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year Helping media companies stay profitable while keeping journalism accessible How? BLOX CMS – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes. BLOX Audience+ – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense. BLOX YieldUp – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess. But the thing I’m really excited about?\nBLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.\nReal-time collaboration – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism. AI-powered tools – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content. One-click publishing to multiple platforms – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place. A modern, intuitive interface – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.\nEarly partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.\nThe Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People. You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.\nGuy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:\n“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”\nBasically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.\nThey see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because \u0026ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.\nThe Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.\nThat’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.\nMy work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.\nNewsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.\nThat’s why BLOX NXT matters. And that’s why I can’t stop talking about it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cms-digital-publishing-blox-nxt/","summary":"A CMS isn\u0026rsquo;t just a tool—it\u0026rsquo;s the backbone of digital publishing.

And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.\nWell, let me tell you—it is. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.\nLet’s get into it.\n1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.\nJPG compresses images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little\u0026hellip; off.\nPNG, on the other hand, keeps everything. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.\nSo, if you care about keeping things crisp, PNG is your best friend.\n2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It. Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do transparency.\nPNG? Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.\nThis is huge if you’re working with logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.\nOr, you know, just use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache.\n3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into blurry, blocky nonsense. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.\nIf you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, stick with PNG. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.\nAnd no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t completely fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.\n4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression at work.\nPNG keeps all the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”\nIf you’re working on art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you like your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.\n5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality gets worse.\nPNG? Doesn’t budge.\nThis is huge if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.\nAlso, if you’re archiving old photos, PNG is the way to go. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, “Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”\nBut Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better? Look, JPG isn’t evil. It’s just… situational.\nIf you’re dealing with big photos and need to save space, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that don’t need to be perfect.\nBut if you’re working with logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine, PNG is the move.\nFinal Thoughts So next time you’re about to hit \u0026ldquo;Save As,\u0026rdquo; ask yourself: Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later? If the answer to any of those is yes, PNG all the way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: \u003cstrong\u003ePNG or JPG?\u003c/strong\u003e And suddenly, you pause.

This is the one?\nBecause for the longest time, I didn’t.\nMoving to New York, I figured finding good bread would be easy.\nI mean, it’s NYC! Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.\nBut Italian-style bread? That was a different story.\nToo Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless? The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:\n1️⃣ Too soft—like, pillow soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.\n2️⃣ Too sweet—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.\n3️⃣ Too tasteless—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite\u0026hellip; nothing. Just air and disappointment.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the prices.\nArtisan bakeries? Amazing.\nBut unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.\nA Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer) Enter: My Wife, The Genius.\nLast Christmas, B (my wife) surprised me with a bread machine.\nHonestly? I wasn’t expecting it.\nI’d casually (let’s say \u0026ldquo;casually\u0026rdquo;) complained:\nHow expensive good bread was. How nothing tasted quite right. How I wished I could just make my own. Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom! Bread machine under the tree.\n(I love you, B ❤️)\nNow, I’d love to say my first loaf came out perfect.\nThat I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created a masterpiece.\nBut let’s be real—it was a disaster.\nDense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency.\n(Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.)\nTurns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.\nBread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba) In Italy, we don’t have a special “bread flour” on supermarket shelves.\nInstead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure.\nSimple, right?\nWell, try finding Manitoba flour in New York.\nI dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.\nEventually, I cracked the code:\n✔ Just buy bread flour. Problem solved.\nBut then I had another discovery—one that changed everything:\nSemolina: The Secret Weapon The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing.\n✔ The crust had that snap.\n✔ The inside had more flavor.\n✔ The whole loaf just felt… right.\nNot easy to find, but totally worth the effort.\nAnd that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements.\nI love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better.\nMaybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows? Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda. Let’s talk cost.\nMaking bread at home isn’t free.\nGood flour isn’t cheap.\nAnd yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).\nBut\u0026hellip;\n✔ Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? Nope.\n✔ Is it way better than supermarket bread? Absolutely.\n✔ Does it take more than four minutes of effort?

No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.\nAt first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… until it didn’t.\nJekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:\nSlow build times – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee. Ruby dependencies – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon. Outdated themes – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012. I tried alternatives:\nGhost – Overkill for a simple blog. WordPress – Too bloated. Eleventy – Cool, but required too much setup. Pelican – Python-based, but didn’t click with me. Then I found Hugo—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.\nWhy I Stuck with GitHub Pages I kept everything on GitHub Pages because:\nIt’s free – No hosting costs. Free is always good. Automatic updates – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly. Easy domain linking – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle. No maintenance – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish. Version control built-in – I can roll back changes if I break something (which happens often). With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup) Unlike Jekyll, which requires bundle install and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.\nOn macOS:\nbrew install hugo\nOn Windows: Download it from Hugo’s GitHub releases and add it to your PATH.\nOn Linux:\nsudo apt install hugo\nTo verify the installation:\nhugo version\rThat’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.\nStep 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…) At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s content/posts/ folder, and everything would work.\nIt didn’t.\nWhat Broke? Folder structure – Jekyll stores posts in _posts/, but Hugo expects them in content/posts/. Front matter differences – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON. Permalinks – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently. To move the posts:\nmkdir -p content/posts\rmv _posts/* content/posts/\rThen, I had to clean up the front matter:\nfind content/posts -type f -name \u0026quot;*.\rmd\u0026quot; -exec sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \\;\rThat was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… until it isn’t.\nStep 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making) I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:\nMainroad – Clean, but too plain. Anubis – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted. Hello-Friend – Nice, but missing features I needed. PaperMod – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak. Installing PaperMod was simple:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod\rThen, I updated config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot;\rFor now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.\nStep 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken) I ran:\nhugo server -D\r…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.\nWhat Went Wrong? Jekyll’s /assets/ folder didn’t move – I had to copy it manually. Relative links broke – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll. Markdown formatting was stricter – Sloppy formatting? Not happening. After fixing those, my site finally worked.\nStep 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…) Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.\nRun Hugo’s build command\nhugo\rThis generates a public/ folder with the static files.\nPush to GitHub\ncd public\rgit initgit add .git commit -m \u0026quot;Deploy Hugo site\u0026quot;\rgit push origin main\rAt first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up GitHub Actions to automate everything.\nStep 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone) Enable Dark Mode [params] defaultTheme = \u0026quot;dark\u0026quot;\rEnable Search [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]\rCustomize Sidebar Profile [params.profileMode] enabled = true title = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;images/profile.jpg\u0026quot;\rEvery time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.\nWas It Worth It? Hugo is fast – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait. No more Ruby dependencies – No bundle exec, no errors, no wasted time. PaperMod works out of the box – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization. What I’d Do Differently Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually. Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once. Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down. Why I’ll Keep Blogging This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.\nA personal blog is like a journal – It helps me organize my thoughts. It’s my escape from social media – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen. It’s mine, forever – No company can shadowban or de-platform me. I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.\nWhat I do know is this:\nI like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet.

I tried:\n✔ Sticky notes (good luck finding them when I actually need them\u0026hellip; they vanish into another dimension).\n✔ To-do list apps (too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week).\n✔ Google Docs (a black hole where ideas go to die).\n✔ My own memory (don’t even ask).\nNothing worked.\nThen I stumbled upon Notion, and suddenly, my brain had a backup system.\nWhy Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed) I’ve always been skeptical of “all-in-one” productivity tools.\nEvery app promises to be the last one you’ll ever need—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think.\nNotion is the first one that actually adapts to me.\nIt’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once. But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a blank canvas, and I decide the rules. The free version is actually good. Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using a relic from 2010. I can publish and share pages instantly. No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done. I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost. Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—they all have a home now.

Yeah, I know—Notion doesn’t work offline.\nFor most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? It doesn’t matter.\nI work online all the time. My job as a developer is remote.

No.\nHere’s what actually happens.\nStep 1: The Grand Vision (\u0026ldquo;I know exactly how to do this.\u0026rdquo;) You get the ticket. You think, Oh, this is simple.\nYou crack your knuckles. Open your editor. Start typing with confidence.\nYou’re in the zone. The code is flowing. You are an unstoppable force. A coding genius. You should write a book about this.\nStep 2: The First Run (\u0026ldquo;Why is it broken?\u0026rdquo;) You confidently hit run.\nImmediate error.\nOkay, no problem. A minor fix. You run it again.\nDifferent error.\nYou frown. Maybe you mistyped something? You check the function names. Everything looks correct.\nRun it again.\nNow it’s really broken.\nThis is the moment you realize: You have no idea what you’re doing.\nStep 3: The Google Phase (\u0026ldquo;Surely someone has solved this before.\u0026rdquo;) You open Google. You type something completely ridiculous, like:\n\u0026ldquo;PHP array error help please what is happening\u0026rdquo;\nYou find a Stack Overflow thread from 2012. Someone had a similar problem. The top answer is:\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried restarting your computer?\u0026rdquo;\nYou scroll down. Another answer looks promising.

You start reading answers from people who sound like they barely know what they’re doing—but at this point, you’re desperate.\nYou begin questioning your life choices.\nMaybe I should’ve been a chef? People always need food. Nobody ever asks a steak why it’s not iterating through an array properly.\nStep 5: The Accidental Fix (\u0026ldquo;Wait\u0026hellip; what?\u0026rdquo;) You change one tiny thing—maybe a missing semicolon, maybe a different variable name—and suddenly…\nIt works.\nYou don’t know why.

It worked.\nI was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.\nBut then something strange happened.\nDespite all my so-called productivity, I felt like I was going nowhere.\n❌ Busy, but not fulfilled.\n❌ Efficient, but not effective.\n❌ Always working, but never actually moving forward.\nAnd that’s when I realized: The way we think about productivity is broken.\nThe False Promise of “Getting More Done” Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a lie:\n🛑 That the key to success is efficiency.\n🛑 That if we just optimize our time perfectly, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.\nBut here’s the truth:\nProductivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the right things done. And if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\n1️⃣ You feel overwhelmed. Too much to do, not enough time.\n2️⃣ You try to optimize. Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.\n3️⃣ You get efficient\u0026hellip; at the wrong things. Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually matters.\n4️⃣ You stay stuck in a loop of busyness. Always “doing,” never really progressing.\nThis is the scary part:\nProductivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion. And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.\nI was checking boxes but not moving forward.\nI was working hard but not working smart.\nI was busy—but not productive.\nThe Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition I used to ask myself:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, I ask a better question:\n\u0026ldquo;What can I remove?\u0026rdquo;\nReal productivity isn’t about adding more tasks.\nIt’s about:\n✔ Eliminating distractions.\n✔ Cutting useless work.\n✔ Focusing on what actually moves the needle.\nHere’s how I flipped my mindset:\n1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.\nIt felt productive, but in reality? It was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort.\nBut most of us spend time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nI ask:\n✔ What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?\n✔ What can I cut without any real consequence?\nThen, I ruthlessly focus on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking.\nBut multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time.\nNow, I do the opposite:\n✔ One tab at a time. No distractions.\n✔ One task at a time. Full focus, deep work.\n✔ One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth.\nIt feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort.\nThey spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\n✔ Do fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.\n✔ Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.\n✔ Focus on quality over quantity.\nIronically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\n✔ How much progress I make on things that actually matter.\n✔ How much energy I have left at the end of the day.\n✔ How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.\nI stopped asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd started asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do less, but better?\u0026rdquo;\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\n✔ Instead of doing more, do less—strategically.\n✔ Instead of working harder, work on the right things.\n✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity.\nBecause the most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done.\nThey’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret.\nIt’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity-trap-why-doing-more-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductivity was about doing more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✔ More tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More efficiency.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More checkboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn’t constantly \u003cstrong\u003eoptimizing, planning, and squeezing every second\u003c/strong\u003e for maximum output, I was failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at first? \u003cstrong\u003eIt worked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting things done.

I’d see guys with thick, full beards and think, Yeah, that’s just not for me.\nIt wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:\n✔ I shave because I always have.\n✔ I’m just not a beard person.\nAnd then, one day\u0026hellip; I didn’t shave.\nThe Accidental Beard Experiment I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, I shall grow a beard!\nIt started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had more stubble than usual.\nNormally, this would have annoyed me. But this time?\nI let it stay.\nAt first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me. I\u0026rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, Who is this guy?\nThe itchy phase was real.\nThe awkward patchy phase was even more real.\nBut the strangest part?\nI kind of liked it.\nI started noticing little things:\nIt made me look older (or maybe just different). It changed the shape of my face. I kept catching myself stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher. And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a reminder that something was changing.\nWhy Growing a Beard Felt So… Different It’s funny how something as simple as not shaving can change the way you see yourself.\nI looked different. My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a real-life Instagram filter. I felt different. There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more deliberate. Like I had made a choice, even if that choice was just to\u0026hellip; not shave. Other people noticed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You look… more Italian now.\u0026rdquo; (That one made me laugh.) I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, when all I did was\u0026hellip; nothing.\nAnd every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.\nWhat I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing Growing a beard didn’t change my life.\nBut it did make me realize something important.\nSo many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults”—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.\nFor years, I thought:\n✔ I’m a clean-shaven guy.\n✔ Beards don’t suit me.\n✔ This is just how I look.\nAnd then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.\nIt made me wonder:\nHow many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?\nI’m not a morning person. (Or am I just used to staying up late?) I don’t like public speaking. (Or have I just never given it a real chance?) I’m not a beard guy. (Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?) It’s strange how something as simple as not shaving can make you question so much more.\nWill I Keep It? I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll shave it off next week.\nMaybe I’ll keep it longer.\nRight now, I’m just letting it be.\nNo expectations. No rules. Just curiosity.\nBut either way, this isn’t really about the beard.\nIt’s about realizing that sometimes, the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.\nAnd honestly?

Everything I do is digital.\nAnd yet, whenever I need to truly think, whenever I need to solve a problem, I reach for something ancient.\nPaper.\nYes, real, dead-tree, old-school paper. With an actual pen. No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.\nWhy Do I Do This? People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?\u0026rdquo;\nI tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.\nBut every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.\nWith paper, I can:\nThink freely without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications. Draw connections with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate. Physically slow down, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving. I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because it works.\nThe Problem with Digital Thinking I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:\nThey make everything too neat.\nTyping forces you into a linear thought process. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.\nBut real problem-solving? It’s messy.\nIt’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.\nDigital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.\nWhen I write on paper, I’m not editing as I think. I’m letting ideas collide, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.\nPaper is My Debugging Tool For some people, thinking happens on the keyboard.\nFor me, thinking happens with a pen.\nIt’s not just about notes—it’s about clarity. It’s about processing. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.\nBefore I write code, I write on paper. I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture. Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out. I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster. Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page. I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios. By the time I finally touch the keyboard, I already know what I’m doing.\nThe Takeaway People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job isn’t the newest or the most advanced—it’s just the one that works.\nNo productivity hack replaces thinking.\nNo app mimics messy creativity.\nNo digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.\nSo yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.\nBut also? Watch me solve problems faster than you.\nBecause in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues.

The features are great, but why is there a subscription for this? It’s perfect on iPhone, but the Windows version looks like it was built in 2009 and abandoned. It’s perfect on Windows, but the iPhone version syncs once every full moon. And just like that, the cycle continues.\nWhy Do I Do This to Myself?

Windows apps are powerful, but most of them were designed by people who hate UI. The “cross-platform” apps? Usually the worst of both worlds.

I eliminate them.\nI’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale mission to find the absolute best—the one perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.\n✔ One backpack.\n✔ One pen.\n✔ One pencil.\n✔ One bathroom set.\nEverything I own must be the best, the most compact, the most portable.\nWhy? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.\n🔹 Not as objects, but as decisions.\nI don’t want five backpacks—I want one that does it all.\nI don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want one that feels perfect in my hand.\nI don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.\nThis isn’t just minimalism.\nIt’s ruthless optimization.\nThe Rules of the Game Finding The One is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.\n1️⃣ Compactness is king. If it’s too bulky, it’s out. Portability without sacrifice.\n2️⃣ One item, zero regrets. Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. This is my Excalibur.\n3️⃣ Quality over everything. If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. No disposable junk.\n4️⃣ No over-engineered nonsense. If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I don’t want it. Keep it simple, durable, and effective.\nThis isn’t about being cheap. It’s about investing in the best, once—and then never thinking about it again.\nThe Search is Brutal You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.\nFinding the one perfect item in any category means sifting through a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right options.\nThe best backpack? Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats. The best pen? Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream pretentious fountain pen guy. Found it. But wait—should I test one more? The best toothbrush? Yes, even this is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. Why is this so hard? Each decision is a battle. A war between function and obsession.\nAnd the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.\n❌ “This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”\n❌ “This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”\n❌ “This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”\nI fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make spreadsheets with pros and cons.\nYes, I’m that person.\nWhy I Love This Insanity Some people call it overthinking.\nI call it engineering my life for efficiency.\nBecause once I’ve chosen The One, I’m free.\n✅ No more switching.\n✅ No more rebuying.\n✅ No more second-guessing.\nJust one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.\nIt’s about reducing decision fatigue. It’s about knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me. It’s about portability, mobility, and adaptability.\nIt’s also about being prepared.\nI’ve moved across continents multiple times. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the freedom of traveling light and the nightmare of clutter.\nSo when the next big move happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.\n❌ No clutter.\n❌ No baggage.\n✅ Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.\nThe Final Boss Battle of Minimalism I’m not naive.\nI know The One doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.\nBut the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.\nIt’s about curating my life to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about choosing quality over quantity in every decision.\nSo if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.\nAnd when I finally find The One?\n✔ I’ll stop looking.\n✔ Until the next perfect version comes out. 😉\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pursuit-of-perfect-quest-for-ultimate-everything/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003cstrong\u003ecollect things\u003c/strong\u003e.

Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board. Timers? Useful—if I remember I set them. To-do lists? I write them, I admire them\u0026hellip; I never check them again. Productivity apps? I collect them like Pokémon. I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? None work if I forget to open them. Pomodoro? Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists. I’ve heard all the usual advice:\n\u0026ldquo;Just choose your priorities!\u0026rdquo; But everything feels important.\n\u0026ldquo;Use reminders!\u0026rdquo; Great idea—if I remember to set them.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?\u0026rdquo; Yes. I lost track of them too.\nIt’s not that I don’t try. I do. But my brain doesn’t follow the rules.\nAnd yet… I still get things done.\nHow I Actually Get Work Done I stopped looking for one perfect system—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of simple tricks and mental hacks to keep myself productive.\nOne task at a time. Multitasking? I quit that. If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing nothing. Writing everything down. My memory is unreliable, so I put everything in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it. The Two-Minute Rule. If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned. But the most important thing?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to use systems made for other people. I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.

I build things for the web. I write code.\nI understand how browsers work.\nAnd yet, somehow, choosing a default browser nearly broke me.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. It’s just a browser.\nA glorified tab holder. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. Freedom.\nOr so I thought.\nIn reality, every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.\nChrome – The original Chromium overlord. Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months? Also yes.\nBecause let’s be real—the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/browser-wars-journey-to-least-annoying-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m a software developer.

Push through resistance. Be disciplined.\nI told myself, “Just do it. No excuses.”\nAnd for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.\nBut then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.\nAnd every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.\nThen I learned something that changed everything:\nWe don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Trying Harder\u0026rdquo; Never Works Think about this:\nTwo people are offered a cigarette.\nThe first person says, “No thanks, I’m trying to quit.” The second person says, “No thanks, I don’t smoke.” The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.\nThe first person is using willpower—constantly resisting. The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted. That’s why most habits fail.\nWe focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.\nThe Identity-Based Approach to Change Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.\nEvery action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.\nIf I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer. If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges. I had to stop seeing habits as things I do and start seeing them as things that define who I am.\nHow I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change I started with small identity shifts:\nInstead of “I should exercise more,” I tell myself “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.” Instead of “I need to focus better,” I remind myself “I’m someone who works with deep focus.” Instead of “I need to stop procrastinating,” I say “I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.” At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:\nThe brain hates cognitive dissonance.\nWhen you tell yourself you are something, you subconsciously start acting like it.\nIf I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day. If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes. If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character. It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.\nThe Difference Between Trying and Being I used to say:\n“I’m trying to exercise more.” “I’m trying to focus better.” “I’m trying to wake up earlier.” Now I say:\n“I’m a person who moves every day.” “I’m someone who works with focus.” “I’m the kind of person who gets up early.” The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.\nAnd identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.\nThe Takeaway Willpower is unreliable.\nMotivation fades.\nBut identity sticks.\nIf you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.\nStart with who you are.\nWant to read more? Become a reader. Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health. Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it. Because the truth is:\nWe don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.\nChange who you are, and the actions will follow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-struggle-to-change-simple-fix-that-works/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think change was about willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder.

Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/motivation-myth-why-waiting-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I waited for \u003cstrong\u003emotivation to strike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductive people\u003c/strong\u003e had some kind of \u003cstrong\u003emagical drive\u003c/strong\u003e I didn’t.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat one day, I’d wake up \u003cstrong\u003efull of energy\u003c/strong\u003e, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects \u003cstrong\u003ewithout procrastinating\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day \u003cstrong\u003enever came.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it never \u003cem\u003ewill.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here’s the truth:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck"},{"content":"Some people think changing your mind is a weakness—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That certainty equals strength and doubt makes you unreliable.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. Not because I’m indecisive, but because I’m learning.\nThe Art of Arguing With Yourself It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly\u0026hellip; doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us \u0026ldquo;won.\u0026rdquo;\nNot because we’re trying to be \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being \u0026ldquo;consistent.\u0026rdquo; But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re frozen in time.\nPeople who adapt, question, and rethink? They’re evolving.\nAnd that means being willing to say,\n\u0026ldquo;I was wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I learned something new.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nIt means embracing doubt, curiosity, and growth.\nThe Takeaway People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what.\nBut real strength? Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about:\nBeing curious enough to question yourself. Being humble enough to admit when you’re wrong. Being smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth. So the next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.\nTake it as proof that you’re evolving.\nBecause the strongest minds?\nThey’re the ones that never stop upgrading.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome people think \u003cstrong\u003echanging your mind is a weakness\u003c/strong\u003e—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever.

Classic exhaustion, right?\nSo I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.\nBut no matter what I did, the fatigue never went away.\nI blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, \u0026ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I realized something.\nI wasn’t just physically exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.\nAnd no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.\nBecause we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.\nThe 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them) 1. Mental Exhaustion (The Overloaded Brain) Too many tabs open (in your browser and your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.\nSymptoms: Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination. 2. Emotional Exhaustion (The Feeling Drain) When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.\nSymptoms: Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap. 3. Creative Exhaustion (The Empty Tank) The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in \u0026lsquo;output mode\u0026rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.\nSymptoms: Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking. 4. Social Exhaustion (The People Drain) It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.\nSymptoms: Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings. 5. Sensory Exhaustion (The Overstimulation Overload) Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.\nSymptoms: Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness. Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest) Here’s the problem: we treat them all the same way.\nMental exhaustion? We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive. Emotional exhaustion? We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them. Creative exhaustion? We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it. Social exhaustion? We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue. Sensory exhaustion? We \u0026ldquo;relax\u0026rdquo; by staring at another screen. We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.\nBut if you don’t know what kind of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.\nSo Here’s How I’m Fixing It Instead of \u0026ldquo;resting\u0026rdquo; in a generic way, I’m resting with purpose.\nI match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.\n1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset Deep work in short bursts – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching. Digital decluttering – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling. Brain dump journaling – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space. 2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue Fewer choices – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to. Emotional boundaries – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions. Journaling – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up. 3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration Consume good input – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things. Change of scenery – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective. Play – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids. 4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude Meaningful connections only – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk. Scheduled alone time – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions. Boundaries – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel. 5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise Digital detox – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode. Minimalist workspace – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload. Silence and darkness – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses. The Takeaway We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about not sleeping enough.\nBut the real question isn’t \u0026ldquo;Am I tired?\u0026rdquo;—it’s \u0026ldquo;What kind of tired am I?\u0026rdquo;\nOnce you figure that out?\nYou can finally start recharging the right way.\nAnd you might just find that you’re not broken.\nYou were just resting wrong.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-youre-always-tired-not-just-about-sleep/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I thought I was just \u003cem\u003etired.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time.

It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reshape them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not that things were better. It’s that we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo\u0026hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that in my life today. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.\nSo next time you find yourself saying, “Things were better back then”, stop and ask:\nOr maybe\u0026hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?\nMaybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how distracted, rushed, and stressed we’ve become.\nMaybe the best days aren’t behind us.\nMaybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver caught yourself thinking, \u003cem\u003e“Things were better back then”\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just \u003cem\u003efelt\u003c/em\u003e different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do this all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\nI remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being \u003cem\u003edisconnected.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)"},{"content":"I don’t know why, but finding the right backpack feels like a life quest—like I’m a video game character on an endless side mission.\nI’ve owned plenty of backpacks.

No organization, just one giant pocket where everything disappears.\nWant your keys? Hope you enjoy an archaeological dig.\nIt’s always the same scenario:\nI’m in a rush.

And when it breaks, it does so with the dramatic flair of a telenovela character. I also break things on purpose—because the best way to fix something is to first see how it falls apart.\nBy day, I’m a PHP backend engineer, making sure systems don’t implode (or at least fail gracefully). I work remotely from Brooklyn 🗽, where my bugs come with complimentary fixes—or at least a very convincing explanation.\nBy night, I trade in debugging for Dad Logic™ (which, let’s be honest, never works 🤷‍♂️) and a never-ending quest to impress my wife with the tech gadgets she never asked for.\n🌍 A Life Between Two Worlds Born in New York, raised in Italy, and now back in the city that never sleeps, my life has been a series of loops—like a recursive function that just won’t quit.\nI didn’t follow a straight path. After spending nearly a decade wrestling with a computer science degree that refused to cooperate, I built my own way forward. Instead of perfect grades, I gained a problem-solving mindset that helps me tackle challenges from unexpected angles.\nAnd while my Italian roots run deep (especially when it comes to good food 🍝), my New York grit means I refuse to settle for anything less than perfection.\n💻 What I Do I love building, fixing, and optimizing—whether it’s backend systems, workflows, or my workspace setup that I will never stop tweaking.\nMy work revolves around:\n✔ PHP Development – Making things work behind the scenes.\n✔ Problem-Solving – Debugging what others avoid.\n✔ System Optimization – Streamlining, automating, improving.\nBut beyond coding, I’m always learning, exploring, and experimenting—from digital minimalism (a great excuse to buy better gadgets) to productivity hacks (that I sometimes ignore).\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Life Outside Code When I’m not deep in terminal commands, I’m:\nBeing a dad – Raising two amazing kids: one who questions everything 🤔, and one who ensures I never sleep.

I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.\nAnd slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:\nThis tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.\nHe Tasted the World — Literally Babies have 30,000 taste buds. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s three times more than adults.\nWhen my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if you could taste shapes, or feel sounds.\nSome researchers believe that babies might experience synesthesia early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally taste textures or feel sounds before those brain connections settle down.\nHonestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.\nHe Saw Things I’ll Never See Again At one point, my son could recognize every human face — no matter the ethnicity. Even monkeys. Yes, monkeys.\nBut then came perceptual narrowing: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, “We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”\nNow he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.\nFor a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.\nAnd we call adults smart?\nHe Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked vision and touch.\nThis is called peripersonal space awareness, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.\nBy eight months, babies expect sensory outcomes — and are surprised when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.\nThat’s if-then logic, built in.\nAnd unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.\nHe Could Hear Every Language on Earth Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones we don’t even speak.\nHindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.\nBut as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.\nThis is called phonetic narrowing. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.\nMeanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.\nHis Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t. There’s this old myth that babies lose the stepping reflex by 2 months. Not true.\nWhat actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.\nIn fact, one study showed that babies who \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the stepping reflex started doing it again… in water, where their legs were lighter.\nSo yes — my son had the walking software pre-installed, he was just waiting for the driver update.\nHe Knows If You\u0026rsquo;re a Good Person Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.\nThey even prefer nice puppets over mean ones. Without being told.\nThat’s proto-moral reasoning. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.\nIf my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.\nHe Does Math. The Impossible Kind. If you show a baby a simple math \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.\nThat’s because they know something’s off.\nIt’s called number sense.\nNo formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.\nIt’s basically unit testing for logic — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.\nBabbling = Precompiled Language When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.\nHe’s compiling syntax.\nStudies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will babble with their hands. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.\nSo language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about brains. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.\nHe’s not learning language. He’s already running the beta release.\nHis Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids Here’s what’s running during nap time:\nNeural pruning REM-driven memory consolidation Cortisol modulation Synaptic reorganization Night mode updates Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.\nIt’s unsupervised machine learning, every night.\nWhich is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.\nFinal Thoughts Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.\nBut none of it — none of it — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.\nHe’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.\nHe’s not just smart.\nHe’s smarter than ChatGPT.\nAnd when I ask him something…\nHe looks me in the eye…\n…and says: \u0026ldquo;Banana.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt\"\u003eMy Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was smart.

No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a Content Management System (CMS) feels like.\nI should know. I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.\nFor me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.\nSo, What Exactly Is a CMS? Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically the control center of a website. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content without touching a single line of code.\nThink of it like a kitchen. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.\nWithout a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. It’s not pretty.\nWhy Should You Care? Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).\nA painfully slow website (the kind that makes you question all your life choices). Articles impossible to find (why is the latest election update buried under \u0026ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil\u0026rdquo;?). A paywall that feels like a trap (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand). A good CMS, though? It keeps everything fast, smooth, and user-friendly. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists actually get paid.\nAnd that’s exactly what we do at BLOX Digital.\nWhy BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT) At BLOX Digital, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build the CMS platform.\nPowering 2,000+ news sites across the U.S. Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year Helping media companies stay profitable while keeping journalism accessible How? BLOX CMS – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes. BLOX Audience+ – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense. BLOX YieldUp – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess. But the thing I’m really excited about?\nBLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.\nReal-time collaboration – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism. AI-powered tools – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content. One-click publishing to multiple platforms – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place. A modern, intuitive interface – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.\nEarly partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.\nThe Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People. You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.\nGuy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:\n“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”\nBasically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.\nThey see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because \u0026ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.\nThe Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.\nThat’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.\nMy work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.\nNewsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.\nThat’s why BLOX NXT matters.

And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.\nWell, let me tell you—it is. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.\nLet’s get into it.\n1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.\nJPG compresses images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little\u0026hellip; off.\nPNG, on the other hand, keeps everything. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.\nSo, if you care about keeping things crisp, PNG is your best friend.\n2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It. Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do transparency.\nPNG? Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.\nThis is huge if you’re working with logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.\nOr, you know, just use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache.\n3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into blurry, blocky nonsense. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.\nIf you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, stick with PNG. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.\nAnd no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t completely fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.\n4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression at work.\nPNG keeps all the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”\nIf you’re working on art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you like your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.\n5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality gets worse.\nPNG? Doesn’t budge.\nThis is huge if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.\nAlso, if you’re archiving old photos, PNG is the way to go. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, “Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”\nBut Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better? Look, JPG isn’t evil. It’s just… situational.\nIf you’re dealing with big photos and need to save space, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that don’t need to be perfect.\nBut if you’re working with logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine, PNG is the move.\nFinal Thoughts So next time you’re about to hit \u0026ldquo;Save As,\u0026rdquo; ask yourself: Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later? If the answer to any of those is yes, PNG all the way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: \u003cstrong\u003ePNG or JPG?\u003c/strong\u003e And suddenly, you pause.

This is the one?\nBecause for the longest time, I didn’t.\nMoving to New York, I figured finding good bread would be easy.\nI mean, it’s NYC! Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.\nBut Italian-style bread? That was a different story.\nToo Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless? The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:\n1️⃣ Too soft—like, pillow soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.\n2️⃣ Too sweet—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.\n3️⃣ Too tasteless—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite\u0026hellip; nothing. Just air and disappointment.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the prices.\nArtisan bakeries? Amazing.\nBut unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.\nA Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer) Enter: My Wife, The Genius.\nLast Christmas, B (my wife) surprised me with a bread machine.\nHonestly? I wasn’t expecting it.\nI’d casually (let’s say \u0026ldquo;casually\u0026rdquo;) complained:\nHow expensive good bread was. How nothing tasted quite right. How I wished I could just make my own. Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom! Bread machine under the tree.\n(I love you, B ❤️)\nNow, I’d love to say my first loaf came out perfect.\nThat I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created a masterpiece.\nBut let’s be real—it was a disaster.\nDense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency.\n(Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.)\nTurns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.\nBread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba) In Italy, we don’t have a special “bread flour” on supermarket shelves.\nInstead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure.\nSimple, right?\nWell, try finding Manitoba flour in New York.\nI dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.\nEventually, I cracked the code:\n✔ Just buy bread flour. Problem solved.\nBut then I had another discovery—one that changed everything:\nSemolina: The Secret Weapon The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing.\n✔ The crust had that snap.\n✔ The inside had more flavor.\n✔ The whole loaf just felt… right.\nNot easy to find, but totally worth the effort.\nAnd that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements.\nI love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better.\nMaybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows? Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda. Let’s talk cost.\nMaking bread at home isn’t free.\nGood flour isn’t cheap.\nAnd yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).\nBut\u0026hellip;\n✔ Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? Nope.\n✔ Is it way better than supermarket bread? Absolutely.\n✔ Does it take more than four minutes of effort? Not really.\nFour minutes to throw ingredients in, press a button, and then just wait.\nThat’s it.\n✔ No kneading.\n✔ No babysitting dough.\n✔ Just a little patience.\nAnd the best part? My house smells like a bakery every time.\nThe Never-Ending Bread Journey So here I am, an Italian guy in NYC, still tweaking, learning, experimenting—\nBut finally—finally—happy with my bread.\nAnd if I ever move again (hey, it’s happened before), at least I know one thing:\nGood bread isn’t something you find.

No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.\nAt first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… until it didn’t.\nJekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:\nSlow build times – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee. Ruby dependencies – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon. Outdated themes – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012. I tried alternatives:\nGhost – Overkill for a simple blog. WordPress – Too bloated. Eleventy – Cool, but required too much setup. Pelican – Python-based, but didn’t click with me. Then I found Hugo—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.\nWhy I Stuck with GitHub Pages I kept everything on GitHub Pages because:\nIt’s free – No hosting costs. Free is always good. Automatic updates – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly. Easy domain linking – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle. No maintenance – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish. Version control built-in – I can roll back changes if I break something (which happens often). With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup) Unlike Jekyll, which requires bundle install and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.\nOn macOS:\nbrew install hugo\nOn Windows: Download it from Hugo’s GitHub releases and add it to your PATH.\nOn Linux:\nsudo apt install hugo\nTo verify the installation:\nhugo version\rThat’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.\nStep 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…) At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s content/posts/ folder, and everything would work.\nIt didn’t.\nWhat Broke? Folder structure – Jekyll stores posts in _posts/, but Hugo expects them in content/posts/. Front matter differences – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON. Permalinks – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently. To move the posts:\nmkdir -p content/posts\rmv _posts/* content/posts/\rThen, I had to clean up the front matter:\nfind content/posts -type f -name \u0026quot;*.\rmd\u0026quot; -exec sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \\;\rThat was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… until it isn’t.\nStep 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making) I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:\nMainroad – Clean, but too plain. Anubis – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted. Hello-Friend – Nice, but missing features I needed. PaperMod – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak. Installing PaperMod was simple:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod\rThen, I updated config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot;\rFor now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.\nStep 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken) I ran:\nhugo server -D\r…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.\nWhat Went Wrong? Jekyll’s /assets/ folder didn’t move – I had to copy it manually. Relative links broke – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll. Markdown formatting was stricter – Sloppy formatting? Not happening. After fixing those, my site finally worked.\nStep 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…) Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.\nRun Hugo’s build command\nhugo\rThis generates a public/ folder with the static files.\nPush to GitHub\ncd public\rgit initgit add .git commit -m \u0026quot;Deploy Hugo site\u0026quot;\rgit push origin main\rAt first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up GitHub Actions to automate everything.\nStep 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone) Enable Dark Mode [params] defaultTheme = \u0026quot;dark\u0026quot;\rEnable Search [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]\rCustomize Sidebar Profile [params.profileMode] enabled = true title = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;images/profile.jpg\u0026quot;\rEvery time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.\nWas It Worth It? Hugo is fast – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait. No more Ruby dependencies – No bundle exec, no errors, no wasted time. PaperMod works out of the box – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization. What I’d Do Differently Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually. Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once. Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down. Why I’ll Keep Blogging This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.\nA personal blog is like a journal – It helps me organize my thoughts. It’s my escape from social media – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen. It’s mine, forever – No company can shadowban or de-platform me. I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.\nWhat I do know is this:\nI like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet.

But ask me where I saved that important note from last week? Gone. Ask me what I was about to do five seconds ago? No idea.\nMy brain has this incredible ability to cling to completely useless information while ruthlessly discarding the things I actually need.\nI’ve spent years searching for a way to keep my thoughts, projects, and tasks organized. I tried:\n✔ Sticky notes (good luck finding them when I actually need them\u0026hellip; they vanish into another dimension).\n✔ To-do list apps (too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week).\n✔ Google Docs (a black hole where ideas go to die).\n✔ My own memory (don’t even ask).\nNothing worked.\nThen I stumbled upon Notion, and suddenly, my brain had a backup system.\nWhy Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed) I’ve always been skeptical of “all-in-one” productivity tools.\nEvery app promises to be the last one you’ll ever need—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think.\nNotion is the first one that actually adapts to me.\nIt’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once. But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a blank canvas, and I decide the rules. The free version is actually good. Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using a relic from 2010. I can publish and share pages instantly. No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done. I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost. Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—they all have a home now. And somehow, I can actually find them when I need them. Before Notion, my workflow was a mess.\nNotes buried in random text files. Ideas scattered in Google Keep, which I’d forget existed. Tasks floating in my head, patiently waiting to be forgotten. Now? Everything is in one place. Exactly where I expect it to be.\nIt’s like having my own personal knowledge base, and for the first time, I actually trust my system.\nWhat About the Offline Mode? Yeah, I know—Notion doesn’t work offline.\nFor most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? It doesn’t matter.\nI work online all the time. My job as a developer is remote. My files live in the cloud. My meetings are on video calls.\nThe only time I’d need offline notes is if I were stuck in a cabin with no internet—and at that point, I have bigger problems than note-taking.\nLike figuring out how to survive without Stack Overflow.\nFor my actual, daily reality, Notion’s always-online approach isn’t a limitation.\nIt’s just how I already work.\nThe Takeaway I didn’t think I needed Notion.\nI thought I just needed to be more disciplined or find the “right” system to organize my thoughts. I assumed I was just bad at remembering things, and that was that.\nBut now? I can’t imagine functioning without it.\nIf you’ve ever felt like your thoughts are scattered across a dozen places, if you struggle to remember things you actually need, if you’ve tried every productivity tool and nothing stuck—\nNotion might be exactly what your brain has been waiting for.\nAnd unlike my real brain, it actually remembers things.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/notion-external-brain-that-works-for-me/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I’ve been at war with \u003cstrong\u003emy own memory\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m great at solving problems, debugging complex code, and figuring out tricky logic flows.

No.\nHere’s what actually happens.\nStep 1: The Grand Vision (\u0026ldquo;I know exactly how to do this.\u0026rdquo;) You get the ticket. You think, Oh, this is simple.\nYou crack your knuckles. Open your editor. Start typing with confidence.\nYou’re in the zone. The code is flowing. You are an unstoppable force. A coding genius. You should write a book about this.\nStep 2: The First Run (\u0026ldquo;Why is it broken?\u0026rdquo;) You confidently hit run.\nImmediate error.\nOkay, no problem. A minor fix. You run it again.\nDifferent error.\nYou frown. Maybe you mistyped something? You check the function names. Everything looks correct.\nRun it again.\nNow it’s really broken.\nThis is the moment you realize: You have no idea what you’re doing.\nStep 3: The Google Phase (\u0026ldquo;Surely someone has solved this before.\u0026rdquo;) You open Google. You type something completely ridiculous, like:\n\u0026ldquo;PHP array error help please what is happening\u0026rdquo;\nYou find a Stack Overflow thread from 2012. Someone had a similar problem. The top answer is:\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried restarting your computer?\u0026rdquo;\nYou scroll down. Another answer looks promising. You copy and paste the code without reading it.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nStep 4: The Deep Spiral (\u0026ldquo;I have made a terrible mistake.\u0026rdquo;) You start adding random print statements.\nYou go deeper into Stack Overflow. You start reading answers from people who sound like they barely know what they’re doing—but at this point, you’re desperate.\nYou begin questioning your life choices.\nMaybe I should’ve been a chef? People always need food. Nobody ever asks a steak why it’s not iterating through an array properly.\nStep 5: The Accidental Fix (\u0026ldquo;Wait\u0026hellip; what?\u0026rdquo;) You change one tiny thing—maybe a missing semicolon, maybe a different variable name—and suddenly…\nIt works.\nYou don’t know why. You don’t care.\nYou immediately push the fix before it breaks again.\nStep 6: The \u0026ldquo;Good Enough\u0026rdquo; Phase (\u0026ldquo;I’ll refactor this later.\u0026rdquo;) You know the code is messy. You know future-you will hate this.\nBut you tell yourself:\n\u0026ldquo;I’ll clean it up later.\u0026rdquo;\nYou never do.\nStep 7: The Code Review Horror (\u0026ldquo;What was I thinking?\u0026rdquo;) Two weeks later, someone reviews your code.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, why is there a console.log('WHY IS THIS BROKEN') in here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is this function name supposed to be fixThisPleaseFinal_v3()?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you… copy this from Stack Overflow?\u0026rdquo;\nYou avoid eye contact.

It worked.\nI was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.\nBut then something strange happened.\nDespite all my so-called productivity, I felt like I was going nowhere.\n❌ Busy, but not fulfilled.\n❌ Efficient, but not effective.\n❌ Always working, but never actually moving forward.\nAnd that’s when I realized: The way we think about productivity is broken.\nThe False Promise of “Getting More Done” Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a lie:\n🛑 That the key to success is efficiency.\n🛑 That if we just optimize our time perfectly, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.\nBut here’s the truth:\nProductivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the right things done. And if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\n1️⃣ You feel overwhelmed. Too much to do, not enough time.\n2️⃣ You try to optimize. Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.\n3️⃣ You get efficient\u0026hellip; at the wrong things. Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually matters.\n4️⃣ You stay stuck in a loop of busyness. Always “doing,” never really progressing.\nThis is the scary part:\nProductivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion. And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.\nI was checking boxes but not moving forward.\nI was working hard but not working smart.\nI was busy—but not productive.\nThe Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition I used to ask myself:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, I ask a better question:\n\u0026ldquo;What can I remove?\u0026rdquo;\nReal productivity isn’t about adding more tasks.\nIt’s about:\n✔ Eliminating distractions.\n✔ Cutting useless work.\n✔ Focusing on what actually moves the needle.\nHere’s how I flipped my mindset:\n1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.\nIt felt productive, but in reality? It was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort.\nBut most of us spend time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nI ask:\n✔ What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?\n✔ What can I cut without any real consequence?\nThen, I ruthlessly focus on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking.\nBut multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time.\nNow, I do the opposite:\n✔ One tab at a time. No distractions.\n✔ One task at a time. Full focus, deep work.\n✔ One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth.\nIt feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort.\nThey spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\n✔ Do fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.\n✔ Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.\n✔ Focus on quality over quantity.\nIronically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\n✔ How much progress I make on things that actually matter.\n✔ How much energy I have left at the end of the day.\n✔ How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.\nI stopped asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd started asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do less, but better?\u0026rdquo;\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\n✔ Instead of doing more, do less—strategically.\n✔ Instead of working harder, work on the right things.\n✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity.\nBecause the most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done.\nThey’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret.\nIt’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity-trap-why-doing-more-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductivity was about doing more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✔ More tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More efficiency.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More checkboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn’t constantly \u003cstrong\u003eoptimizing, planning, and squeezing every second\u003c/strong\u003e for maximum output, I was failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at first? \u003cstrong\u003eIt worked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting things done.

I’d see guys with thick, full beards and think, Yeah, that’s just not for me.\nIt wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:\n✔ I shave because I always have.\n✔ I’m just not a beard person.\nAnd then, one day\u0026hellip; I didn’t shave.\nThe Accidental Beard Experiment I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, I shall grow a beard!\nIt started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had more stubble than usual.\nNormally, this would have annoyed me. But this time?\nI let it stay.\nAt first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me. I\u0026rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, Who is this guy?\nThe itchy phase was real.\nThe awkward patchy phase was even more real.\nBut the strangest part?\nI kind of liked it.\nI started noticing little things:\nIt made me look older (or maybe just different). It changed the shape of my face. I kept catching myself stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher. And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a reminder that something was changing.\nWhy Growing a Beard Felt So… Different It’s funny how something as simple as not shaving can change the way you see yourself.\nI looked different. My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a real-life Instagram filter. I felt different. There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more deliberate. Like I had made a choice, even if that choice was just to\u0026hellip; not shave. Other people noticed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You look… more Italian now.\u0026rdquo; (That one made me laugh.) I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, when all I did was\u0026hellip; nothing.\nAnd every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.\nWhat I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing Growing a beard didn’t change my life.\nBut it did make me realize something important.\nSo many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults”—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.\nFor years, I thought:\n✔ I’m a clean-shaven guy.\n✔ Beards don’t suit me.\n✔ This is just how I look.\nAnd then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.\nIt made me wonder:\nHow many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?\nI’m not a morning person. (Or am I just used to staying up late?) I don’t like public speaking. (Or have I just never given it a real chance?) I’m not a beard guy. (Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?) It’s strange how something as simple as not shaving can make you question so much more.\nWill I Keep It? I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll shave it off next week.\nMaybe I’ll keep it longer.\nRight now, I’m just letting it be.\nNo expectations. No rules. Just curiosity.\nBut either way, this isn’t really about the beard.\nIt’s about realizing that sometimes, the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.\nAnd honestly? That’s worth exploring.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/i-never-thought-id-grow-a-beard/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been a \u003cstrong\u003ebeard guy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just \u003cstrong\u003ehappened\u003c/strong\u003e to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age.

Everything I do is digital.\nAnd yet, whenever I need to truly think, whenever I need to solve a problem, I reach for something ancient.\nPaper.\nYes, real, dead-tree, old-school paper. With an actual pen. No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.\nWhy Do I Do This? People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?\u0026rdquo;\nI tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.\nBut every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.\nWith paper, I can:\nThink freely without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications. Draw connections with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate. Physically slow down, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving. I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because it works.\nThe Problem with Digital Thinking I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:\nThey make everything too neat.\nTyping forces you into a linear thought process. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.\nBut real problem-solving? It’s messy.\nIt’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.\nDigital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.\nWhen I write on paper, I’m not editing as I think. I’m letting ideas collide, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.\nPaper is My Debugging Tool For some people, thinking happens on the keyboard.\nFor me, thinking happens with a pen.\nIt’s not just about notes—it’s about clarity. It’s about processing. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.\nBefore I write code, I write on paper. I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture. Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out. I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster. Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page. I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios. By the time I finally touch the keyboard, I already know what I’m doing.\nThe Takeaway People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job isn’t the newest or the most advanced—it’s just the one that works.\nNo productivity hack replaces thinking.\nNo app mimics messy creativity.\nNo digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.\nSo yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.\nBut also? Watch me solve problems faster than you.\nBecause in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues.

The features are great, but why is there a subscription for this? It’s perfect on iPhone, but the Windows version looks like it was built in 2009 and abandoned. It’s perfect on Windows, but the iPhone version syncs once every full moon. And just like that, the cycle continues.\nWhy Do I Do This to Myself? I know what you’re thinking:\n\u0026ldquo;Why not just pick one and move on?\u0026rdquo;\nBecause that’s what normal people do. But my brain doesn’t work that way.\nI need flow in my tools.

I can’t un-notice it.\nI have a zero-tolerance policy for inefficiency:\n✔ If an app takes more than two clicks to do something that should take one, it’s dead to me.\n✔ If it’s ugly or the design is inconsistent, I won’t use it, no matter how powerful it is.\n✔ If it’s perfect but has a monthly subscription, I will uninstall it on principle.\nI want my apps to feel invisible, like they don’t exist.

Windows apps are powerful, but most of them were designed by people who hate UI. The “cross-platform” apps? Usually the worst of both worlds.

I eliminate them.\nI’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale mission to find the absolute best—the one perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.\n✔ One backpack.\n✔ One pen.\n✔ One pencil.\n✔ One bathroom set.\nEverything I own must be the best, the most compact, the most portable.\nWhy? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.\n🔹 Not as objects, but as decisions.\nI don’t want five backpacks—I want one that does it all.\nI don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want one that feels perfect in my hand.\nI don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.\nThis isn’t just minimalism.\nIt’s ruthless optimization.\nThe Rules of the Game Finding The One is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.\n1️⃣ Compactness is king. If it’s too bulky, it’s out. Portability without sacrifice.\n2️⃣ One item, zero regrets. Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. This is my Excalibur.\n3️⃣ Quality over everything. If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. No disposable junk.\n4️⃣ No over-engineered nonsense. If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I don’t want it. Keep it simple, durable, and effective.\nThis isn’t about being cheap. It’s about investing in the best, once—and then never thinking about it again.\nThe Search is Brutal You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.\nFinding the one perfect item in any category means sifting through a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right options.\nThe best backpack? Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats. The best pen? Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream pretentious fountain pen guy. Found it. But wait—should I test one more? The best toothbrush? Yes, even this is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. Why is this so hard? Each decision is a battle. A war between function and obsession.\nAnd the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.\n❌ “This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”\n❌ “This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”\n❌ “This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”\nI fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make spreadsheets with pros and cons.\nYes, I’m that person.\nWhy I Love This Insanity Some people call it overthinking.\nI call it engineering my life for efficiency.\nBecause once I’ve chosen The One, I’m free.\n✅ No more switching.\n✅ No more rebuying.\n✅ No more second-guessing.\nJust one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.\nIt’s about reducing decision fatigue. It’s about knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me. It’s about portability, mobility, and adaptability.\nIt’s also about being prepared.\nI’ve moved across continents multiple times. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the freedom of traveling light and the nightmare of clutter.\nSo when the next big move happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.\n❌ No clutter.\n❌ No baggage.\n✅ Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.\nThe Final Boss Battle of Minimalism I’m not naive.\nI know The One doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.\nBut the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.\nIt’s about curating my life to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about choosing quality over quantity in every decision.\nSo if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.\nAnd when I finally find The One?\n✔ I’ll stop looking.\n✔ Until the next perfect version comes out. 😉\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pursuit-of-perfect-quest-for-ultimate-everything/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003cstrong\u003ecollect things\u003c/strong\u003e.

Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board. Timers? Useful—if I remember I set them. To-do lists? I write them, I admire them\u0026hellip; I never check them again. Productivity apps? I collect them like Pokémon. I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? None work if I forget to open them. Pomodoro? Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists. I’ve heard all the usual advice:\n\u0026ldquo;Just choose your priorities!\u0026rdquo; But everything feels important.\n\u0026ldquo;Use reminders!\u0026rdquo; Great idea—if I remember to set them.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?\u0026rdquo; Yes. I lost track of them too.\nIt’s not that I don’t try. I do. But my brain doesn’t follow the rules.\nAnd yet… I still get things done.\nHow I Actually Get Work Done I stopped looking for one perfect system—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of simple tricks and mental hacks to keep myself productive.\nOne task at a time. Multitasking? I quit that. If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing nothing. Writing everything down. My memory is unreliable, so I put everything in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it. The Two-Minute Rule. If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned. But the most important thing?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to use systems made for other people. I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.

I build things for the web. I write code.\nI understand how browsers work.\nAnd yet, somehow, choosing a default browser nearly broke me.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. It’s just a browser.\nA glorified tab holder. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. Freedom.\nOr so I thought.\nIn reality, every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.\nChrome – The original Chromium overlord. Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months? Also yes.\nBecause let’s be real—the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/browser-wars-journey-to-least-annoying-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m a software developer.

Push through resistance. Be disciplined.\nI told myself, “Just do it. No excuses.”\nAnd for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.\nBut then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.\nAnd every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.\nThen I learned something that changed everything:\nWe don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Trying Harder\u0026rdquo; Never Works Think about this:\nTwo people are offered a cigarette.\nThe first person says, “No thanks, I’m trying to quit.” The second person says, “No thanks, I don’t smoke.” The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.\nThe first person is using willpower—constantly resisting. The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted. That’s why most habits fail.\nWe focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.\nThe Identity-Based Approach to Change Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.\nEvery action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.\nIf I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer. If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges. I had to stop seeing habits as things I do and start seeing them as things that define who I am.\nHow I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change I started with small identity shifts:\nInstead of “I should exercise more,” I tell myself “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.” Instead of “I need to focus better,” I remind myself “I’m someone who works with deep focus.” Instead of “I need to stop procrastinating,” I say “I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.” At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:\nThe brain hates cognitive dissonance.\nWhen you tell yourself you are something, you subconsciously start acting like it.\nIf I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day. If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes. If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character. It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.\nThe Difference Between Trying and Being I used to say:\n“I’m trying to exercise more.” “I’m trying to focus better.” “I’m trying to wake up earlier.” Now I say:\n“I’m a person who moves every day.” “I’m someone who works with focus.” “I’m the kind of person who gets up early.” The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.\nAnd identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.\nThe Takeaway Willpower is unreliable.\nMotivation fades.\nBut identity sticks.\nIf you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.\nStart with who you are.\nWant to read more? Become a reader. Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health. Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it. Because the truth is:\nWe don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.\nChange who you are, and the actions will follow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-struggle-to-change-simple-fix-that-works/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think change was about willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder.

Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/motivation-myth-why-waiting-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I waited for \u003cstrong\u003emotivation to strike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductive people\u003c/strong\u003e had some kind of \u003cstrong\u003emagical drive\u003c/strong\u003e I didn’t.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat one day, I’d wake up \u003cstrong\u003efull of energy\u003c/strong\u003e, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects \u003cstrong\u003ewithout procrastinating\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day \u003cstrong\u003enever came.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it never \u003cem\u003ewill.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here’s the truth:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck"},{"content":"Some people think changing your mind is a weakness—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That certainty equals strength and doubt makes you unreliable.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. Not because I’m indecisive, but because I’m learning.\nThe Art of Arguing With Yourself It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly\u0026hellip; doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us \u0026ldquo;won.\u0026rdquo;\nNot because we’re trying to be \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being \u0026ldquo;consistent.\u0026rdquo; But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re frozen in time.\nPeople who adapt, question, and rethink? They’re evolving.\nAnd that means being willing to say,\n\u0026ldquo;I was wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I learned something new.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nIt means embracing doubt, curiosity, and growth.\nThe Takeaway People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what.\nBut real strength? Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about:\nBeing curious enough to question yourself. Being humble enough to admit when you’re wrong. Being smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth. So the next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.\nTake it as proof that you’re evolving.\nBecause the strongest minds?\nThey’re the ones that never stop upgrading.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome people think \u003cstrong\u003echanging your mind is a weakness\u003c/strong\u003e—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever.

Classic exhaustion, right?\nSo I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.\nBut no matter what I did, the fatigue never went away.\nI blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, \u0026ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I realized something.\nI wasn’t just physically exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.\nAnd no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.\nBecause we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.\nThe 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them) 1. Mental Exhaustion (The Overloaded Brain) Too many tabs open (in your browser and your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.\nSymptoms: Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination. 2. Emotional Exhaustion (The Feeling Drain) When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.\nSymptoms: Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap. 3. Creative Exhaustion (The Empty Tank) The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in \u0026lsquo;output mode\u0026rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.\nSymptoms: Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking. 4. Social Exhaustion (The People Drain) It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.\nSymptoms: Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings. 5. Sensory Exhaustion (The Overstimulation Overload) Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.\nSymptoms: Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness. Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest) Here’s the problem: we treat them all the same way.\nMental exhaustion? We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive. Emotional exhaustion? We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them. Creative exhaustion? We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it. Social exhaustion? We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue. Sensory exhaustion? We \u0026ldquo;relax\u0026rdquo; by staring at another screen. We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.\nBut if you don’t know what kind of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.\nSo Here’s How I’m Fixing It Instead of \u0026ldquo;resting\u0026rdquo; in a generic way, I’m resting with purpose.\nI match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.\n1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset Deep work in short bursts – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching. Digital decluttering – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling. Brain dump journaling – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space. 2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue Fewer choices – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to. Emotional boundaries – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions. Journaling – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up. 3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration Consume good input – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things. Change of scenery – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective. Play – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids. 4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude Meaningful connections only – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk. Scheduled alone time – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions. Boundaries – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel. 5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise Digital detox – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode. Minimalist workspace – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload. Silence and darkness – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses. The Takeaway We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about not sleeping enough.\nBut the real question isn’t \u0026ldquo;Am I tired?\u0026rdquo;—it’s \u0026ldquo;What kind of tired am I?\u0026rdquo;\nOnce you figure that out?\nYou can finally start recharging the right way.\nAnd you might just find that you’re not broken.\nYou were just resting wrong.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-youre-always-tired-not-just-about-sleep/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I thought I was just \u003cem\u003etired.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time.

It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reshape them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not that things were better. It’s that we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo\u0026hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that in my life today. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.\nSo next time you find yourself saying, “Things were better back then”, stop and ask:\nOr maybe\u0026hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?\nMaybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how distracted, rushed, and stressed we’ve become.\nMaybe the best days aren’t behind us.\nMaybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver caught yourself thinking, \u003cem\u003e“Things were better back then”\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just \u003cem\u003efelt\u003c/em\u003e different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do this all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\nI remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being \u003cem\u003edisconnected.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)"},{"content":"I don’t know why, but finding the right backpack feels like a life quest—like I’m a video game character on an endless side mission.\nI’ve owned plenty of backpacks.

No organization, just one giant pocket where everything disappears.\nWant your keys? Hope you enjoy an archaeological dig.\nIt’s always the same scenario:\nI’m in a rush.

And when it breaks, it does so with the dramatic flair of a telenovela character. I also break things on purpose—because the best way to fix something is to first see how it falls apart.\nBy day, I’m a PHP backend engineer, making sure systems don’t implode (or at least fail gracefully). I work remotely from Brooklyn 🗽, where my bugs come with complimentary fixes—or at least a very convincing explanation.\nBy night, I trade in debugging for Dad Logic™ (which, let’s be honest, never works 🤷‍♂️) and a never-ending quest to impress my wife with the tech gadgets she never asked for.\n🌍 A Life Between Two Worlds Born in New York, raised in Italy, and now back in the city that never sleeps, my life has been a series of loops—like a recursive function that just won’t quit.\nI didn’t follow a straight path. After spending nearly a decade wrestling with a computer science degree that refused to cooperate, I built my own way forward. Instead of perfect grades, I gained a problem-solving mindset that helps me tackle challenges from unexpected angles.\nAnd while my Italian roots run deep (especially when it comes to good food 🍝), my New York grit means I refuse to settle for anything less than perfection.\n💻 What I Do I love building, fixing, and optimizing—whether it’s backend systems, workflows, or my workspace setup that I will never stop tweaking.\nMy work revolves around:\n✔ PHP Development – Making things work behind the scenes.\n✔ Problem-Solving – Debugging what others avoid.\n✔ System Optimization – Streamlining, automating, improving.\nBut beyond coding, I’m always learning, exploring, and experimenting—from digital minimalism (a great excuse to buy better gadgets) to productivity hacks (that I sometimes ignore).\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Life Outside Code When I’m not deep in terminal commands, I’m:\nBeing a dad – Raising two amazing kids: one who questions everything 🤔, and one who ensures I never sleep.

I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.\nAnd slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:\nThis tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.\nHe Tasted the World — Literally Babies have 30,000 taste buds. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s three times more than adults.\nWhen my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if you could taste shapes, or feel sounds.\nSome researchers believe that babies might experience synesthesia early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally taste textures or feel sounds before those brain connections settle down.\nHonestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.\nHe Saw Things I’ll Never See Again At one point, my son could recognize every human face — no matter the ethnicity. Even monkeys. Yes, monkeys.\nBut then came perceptual narrowing: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, “We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”\nNow he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.\nFor a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.\nAnd we call adults smart?\nHe Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked vision and touch.\nThis is called peripersonal space awareness, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.\nBy eight months, babies expect sensory outcomes — and are surprised when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.\nThat’s if-then logic, built in.\nAnd unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.\nHe Could Hear Every Language on Earth Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones we don’t even speak.\nHindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.\nBut as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.\nThis is called phonetic narrowing. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.\nMeanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.\nHis Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t. There’s this old myth that babies lose the stepping reflex by 2 months. Not true.\nWhat actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.\nIn fact, one study showed that babies who \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the stepping reflex started doing it again… in water, where their legs were lighter.\nSo yes — my son had the walking software pre-installed, he was just waiting for the driver update.\nHe Knows If You\u0026rsquo;re a Good Person Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.\nThey even prefer nice puppets over mean ones. Without being told.\nThat’s proto-moral reasoning. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.\nIf my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.\nHe Does Math. The Impossible Kind. If you show a baby a simple math \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.\nThat’s because they know something’s off.\nIt’s called number sense.\nNo formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.\nIt’s basically unit testing for logic — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.\nBabbling = Precompiled Language When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.\nHe’s compiling syntax.\nStudies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will babble with their hands. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.\nSo language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about brains. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.\nHe’s not learning language. He’s already running the beta release.\nHis Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids Here’s what’s running during nap time:\nNeural pruning REM-driven memory consolidation Cortisol modulation Synaptic reorganization Night mode updates Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.\nIt’s unsupervised machine learning, every night.\nWhich is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.\nFinal Thoughts Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.\nBut none of it — none of it — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.\nHe’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.\nHe’s not just smart.\nHe’s smarter than ChatGPT.\nAnd when I ask him something…\nHe looks me in the eye…\n…and says: \u0026ldquo;Banana.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt\"\u003eMy Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was smart.

No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a Content Management System (CMS) feels like.\nI should know. I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.\nFor me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.\nSo, What Exactly Is a CMS? Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically the control center of a website. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content without touching a single line of code.\nThink of it like a kitchen. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.\nWithout a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. It’s not pretty.\nWhy Should You Care? Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).\nA painfully slow website (the kind that makes you question all your life choices). Articles impossible to find (why is the latest election update buried under \u0026ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil\u0026rdquo;?). A paywall that feels like a trap (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand). A good CMS, though? It keeps everything fast, smooth, and user-friendly. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists actually get paid.\nAnd that’s exactly what we do at BLOX Digital.\nWhy BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT) At BLOX Digital, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build the CMS platform.\nPowering 2,000+ news sites across the U.S. Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year Helping media companies stay profitable while keeping journalism accessible How? BLOX CMS – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes. BLOX Audience+ – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense. BLOX YieldUp – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess. But the thing I’m really excited about?\nBLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.\nReal-time collaboration – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism. AI-powered tools – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content. One-click publishing to multiple platforms – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place. A modern, intuitive interface – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.\nEarly partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.\nThe Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People. You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.\nGuy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:\n“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”\nBasically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.\nThey see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because \u0026ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.\nThe Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.\nThat’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.\nMy work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.\nNewsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.\nThat’s why BLOX NXT matters.

And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.\nWell, let me tell you—it is. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.\nLet’s get into it.\n1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.\nJPG compresses images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little\u0026hellip; off.\nPNG, on the other hand, keeps everything. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.\nSo, if you care about keeping things crisp, PNG is your best friend.\n2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It. Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do transparency.\nPNG? Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.\nThis is huge if you’re working with logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.\nOr, you know, just use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache.\n3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into blurry, blocky nonsense. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.\nIf you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, stick with PNG. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.\nAnd no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t completely fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.\n4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression at work.\nPNG keeps all the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”\nIf you’re working on art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you like your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.\n5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality gets worse.\nPNG? Doesn’t budge.\nThis is huge if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.\nAlso, if you’re archiving old photos, PNG is the way to go. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, “Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”\nBut Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better? Look, JPG isn’t evil. It’s just… situational.\nIf you’re dealing with big photos and need to save space, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that don’t need to be perfect.\nBut if you’re working with logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine, PNG is the move.\nFinal Thoughts So next time you’re about to hit \u0026ldquo;Save As,\u0026rdquo; ask yourself: Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later? If the answer to any of those is yes, PNG all the way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: \u003cstrong\u003ePNG or JPG?\u003c/strong\u003e And suddenly, you pause.

This is the one?\nBecause for the longest time, I didn’t.\nMoving to New York, I figured finding good bread would be easy.\nI mean, it’s NYC! Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.\nBut Italian-style bread? That was a different story.\nToo Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless? The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:\n1️⃣ Too soft—like, pillow soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.\n2️⃣ Too sweet—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.\n3️⃣ Too tasteless—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite\u0026hellip; nothing. Just air and disappointment.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the prices.\nArtisan bakeries? Amazing.\nBut unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.\nA Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer) Enter: My Wife, The Genius.\nLast Christmas, B (my wife) surprised me with a bread machine.\nHonestly? I wasn’t expecting it.\nI’d casually (let’s say \u0026ldquo;casually\u0026rdquo;) complained:\nHow expensive good bread was. How nothing tasted quite right. How I wished I could just make my own. Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom! Bread machine under the tree.\n(I love you, B ❤️)\nNow, I’d love to say my first loaf came out perfect.\nThat I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created a masterpiece.\nBut let’s be real—it was a disaster.\nDense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency.\n(Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.)\nTurns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.\nBread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba) In Italy, we don’t have a special “bread flour” on supermarket shelves.\nInstead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure.\nSimple, right?\nWell, try finding Manitoba flour in New York.\nI dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.\nEventually, I cracked the code:\n✔ Just buy bread flour. Problem solved.\nBut then I had another discovery—one that changed everything:\nSemolina: The Secret Weapon The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing.\n✔ The crust had that snap.\n✔ The inside had more flavor.\n✔ The whole loaf just felt… right.\nNot easy to find, but totally worth the effort.\nAnd that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements.\nI love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better.\nMaybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows? Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda. Let’s talk cost.\nMaking bread at home isn’t free.\nGood flour isn’t cheap.\nAnd yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).\nBut\u0026hellip;\n✔ Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? Nope.\n✔ Is it way better than supermarket bread? Absolutely.\n✔ Does it take more than four minutes of effort? Not really.\nFour minutes to throw ingredients in, press a button, and then just wait.\nThat’s it.\n✔ No kneading.\n✔ No babysitting dough.\n✔ Just a little patience.\nAnd the best part? My house smells like a bakery every time.\nThe Never-Ending Bread Journey So here I am, an Italian guy in NYC, still tweaking, learning, experimenting—\nBut finally—finally—happy with my bread.\nAnd if I ever move again (hey, it’s happened before), at least I know one thing:\nGood bread isn’t something you find.

No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.\nAt first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… until it didn’t.\nJekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:\nSlow build times – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee. Ruby dependencies – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon. Outdated themes – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012. I tried alternatives:\nGhost – Overkill for a simple blog. WordPress – Too bloated. Eleventy – Cool, but required too much setup. Pelican – Python-based, but didn’t click with me. Then I found Hugo—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.\nWhy I Stuck with GitHub Pages I kept everything on GitHub Pages because:\nIt’s free – No hosting costs. Free is always good. Automatic updates – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly. Easy domain linking – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle. No maintenance – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish. Version control built-in – I can roll back changes if I break something (which happens often). With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup) Unlike Jekyll, which requires bundle install and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.\nOn macOS:\nbrew install hugo\nOn Windows: Download it from Hugo’s GitHub releases and add it to your PATH.\nOn Linux:\nsudo apt install hugo\nTo verify the installation:\nhugo version\rThat’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.\nStep 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…) At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s content/posts/ folder, and everything would work.\nIt didn’t.\nWhat Broke? Folder structure – Jekyll stores posts in _posts/, but Hugo expects them in content/posts/. Front matter differences – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON. Permalinks – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently. To move the posts:\nmkdir -p content/posts\rmv _posts/* content/posts/\rThen, I had to clean up the front matter:\nfind content/posts -type f -name \u0026quot;*.\rmd\u0026quot; -exec sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \\;\rThat was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… until it isn’t.\nStep 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making) I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:\nMainroad – Clean, but too plain. Anubis – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted. Hello-Friend – Nice, but missing features I needed. PaperMod – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak. Installing PaperMod was simple:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod\rThen, I updated config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot;\rFor now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.\nStep 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken) I ran:\nhugo server -D\r…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.\nWhat Went Wrong? Jekyll’s /assets/ folder didn’t move – I had to copy it manually. Relative links broke – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll. Markdown formatting was stricter – Sloppy formatting? Not happening. After fixing those, my site finally worked.\nStep 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…) Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.\nRun Hugo’s build command\nhugo\rThis generates a public/ folder with the static files.\nPush to GitHub\ncd public\rgit initgit add .git commit -m \u0026quot;Deploy Hugo site\u0026quot;\rgit push origin main\rAt first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up GitHub Actions to automate everything.\nStep 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone) Enable Dark Mode [params] defaultTheme = \u0026quot;dark\u0026quot;\rEnable Search [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]\rCustomize Sidebar Profile [params.profileMode] enabled = true title = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;images/profile.jpg\u0026quot;\rEvery time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.\nWas It Worth It? Hugo is fast – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait. No more Ruby dependencies – No bundle exec, no errors, no wasted time. PaperMod works out of the box – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization. What I’d Do Differently Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually. Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once. Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down. Why I’ll Keep Blogging This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.\nA personal blog is like a journal – It helps me organize my thoughts. It’s my escape from social media – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen. It’s mine, forever – No company can shadowban or de-platform me. I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.\nWhat I do know is this:\nI like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet.

But ask me where I saved that important note from last week? Gone. Ask me what I was about to do five seconds ago? No idea.\nMy brain has this incredible ability to cling to completely useless information while ruthlessly discarding the things I actually need.\nI’ve spent years searching for a way to keep my thoughts, projects, and tasks organized. I tried:\n✔ Sticky notes (good luck finding them when I actually need them\u0026hellip; they vanish into another dimension).\n✔ To-do list apps (too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week).\n✔ Google Docs (a black hole where ideas go to die).\n✔ My own memory (don’t even ask).\nNothing worked.\nThen I stumbled upon Notion, and suddenly, my brain had a backup system.\nWhy Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed) I’ve always been skeptical of “all-in-one” productivity tools.\nEvery app promises to be the last one you’ll ever need—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think.\nNotion is the first one that actually adapts to me.\nIt’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once. But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a blank canvas, and I decide the rules. The free version is actually good. Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using a relic from 2010. I can publish and share pages instantly. No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done. I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost. Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—they all have a home now. And somehow, I can actually find them when I need them. Before Notion, my workflow was a mess.\nNotes buried in random text files. Ideas scattered in Google Keep, which I’d forget existed. Tasks floating in my head, patiently waiting to be forgotten. Now? Everything is in one place. Exactly where I expect it to be.\nIt’s like having my own personal knowledge base, and for the first time, I actually trust my system.\nWhat About the Offline Mode? Yeah, I know—Notion doesn’t work offline.\nFor most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? It doesn’t matter.\nI work online all the time. My job as a developer is remote. My files live in the cloud. My meetings are on video calls.\nThe only time I’d need offline notes is if I were stuck in a cabin with no internet—and at that point, I have bigger problems than note-taking.\nLike figuring out how to survive without Stack Overflow.\nFor my actual, daily reality, Notion’s always-online approach isn’t a limitation.\nIt’s just how I already work.\nThe Takeaway I didn’t think I needed Notion.\nI thought I just needed to be more disciplined or find the “right” system to organize my thoughts. I assumed I was just bad at remembering things, and that was that.\nBut now? I can’t imagine functioning without it.\nIf you’ve ever felt like your thoughts are scattered across a dozen places, if you struggle to remember things you actually need, if you’ve tried every productivity tool and nothing stuck—\nNotion might be exactly what your brain has been waiting for.\nAnd unlike my real brain, it actually remembers things.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/notion-external-brain-that-works-for-me/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I’ve been at war with \u003cstrong\u003emy own memory\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m great at solving problems, debugging complex code, and figuring out tricky logic flows.

No.\nHere’s what actually happens.\nStep 1: The Grand Vision (\u0026ldquo;I know exactly how to do this.\u0026rdquo;) You get the ticket. You think, Oh, this is simple.\nYou crack your knuckles. Open your editor. Start typing with confidence.\nYou’re in the zone. The code is flowing. You are an unstoppable force. A coding genius. You should write a book about this.\nStep 2: The First Run (\u0026ldquo;Why is it broken?\u0026rdquo;) You confidently hit run.\nImmediate error.\nOkay, no problem. A minor fix. You run it again.\nDifferent error.\nYou frown. Maybe you mistyped something? You check the function names. Everything looks correct.\nRun it again.\nNow it’s really broken.\nThis is the moment you realize: You have no idea what you’re doing.\nStep 3: The Google Phase (\u0026ldquo;Surely someone has solved this before.\u0026rdquo;) You open Google. You type something completely ridiculous, like:\n\u0026ldquo;PHP array error help please what is happening\u0026rdquo;\nYou find a Stack Overflow thread from 2012. Someone had a similar problem. The top answer is:\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried restarting your computer?\u0026rdquo;\nYou scroll down. Another answer looks promising. You copy and paste the code without reading it.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nStep 4: The Deep Spiral (\u0026ldquo;I have made a terrible mistake.\u0026rdquo;) You start adding random print statements.\nYou go deeper into Stack Overflow. You start reading answers from people who sound like they barely know what they’re doing—but at this point, you’re desperate.\nYou begin questioning your life choices.\nMaybe I should’ve been a chef? People always need food. Nobody ever asks a steak why it’s not iterating through an array properly.\nStep 5: The Accidental Fix (\u0026ldquo;Wait\u0026hellip; what?\u0026rdquo;) You change one tiny thing—maybe a missing semicolon, maybe a different variable name—and suddenly…\nIt works.\nYou don’t know why. You don’t care.\nYou immediately push the fix before it breaks again.\nStep 6: The \u0026ldquo;Good Enough\u0026rdquo; Phase (\u0026ldquo;I’ll refactor this later.\u0026rdquo;) You know the code is messy. You know future-you will hate this.\nBut you tell yourself:\n\u0026ldquo;I’ll clean it up later.\u0026rdquo;\nYou never do.\nStep 7: The Code Review Horror (\u0026ldquo;What was I thinking?\u0026rdquo;) Two weeks later, someone reviews your code.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, why is there a console.log('WHY IS THIS BROKEN') in here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is this function name supposed to be fixThisPleaseFinal_v3()?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you… copy this from Stack Overflow?\u0026rdquo;\nYou avoid eye contact.

It worked.\nI was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.\nBut then something strange happened.\nDespite all my so-called productivity, I felt like I was going nowhere.\n❌ Busy, but not fulfilled.\n❌ Efficient, but not effective.\n❌ Always working, but never actually moving forward.\nAnd that’s when I realized: The way we think about productivity is broken.\nThe False Promise of “Getting More Done” Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a lie:\n🛑 That the key to success is efficiency.\n🛑 That if we just optimize our time perfectly, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.\nBut here’s the truth:\nProductivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the right things done. And if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\n1️⃣ You feel overwhelmed. Too much to do, not enough time.\n2️⃣ You try to optimize. Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.\n3️⃣ You get efficient\u0026hellip; at the wrong things. Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually matters.\n4️⃣ You stay stuck in a loop of busyness. Always “doing,” never really progressing.\nThis is the scary part:\nProductivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion. And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.\nI was checking boxes but not moving forward.\nI was working hard but not working smart.\nI was busy—but not productive.\nThe Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition I used to ask myself:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, I ask a better question:\n\u0026ldquo;What can I remove?\u0026rdquo;\nReal productivity isn’t about adding more tasks.\nIt’s about:\n✔ Eliminating distractions.\n✔ Cutting useless work.\n✔ Focusing on what actually moves the needle.\nHere’s how I flipped my mindset:\n1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.\nIt felt productive, but in reality? It was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort.\nBut most of us spend time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nI ask:\n✔ What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?\n✔ What can I cut without any real consequence?\nThen, I ruthlessly focus on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking.\nBut multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time.\nNow, I do the opposite:\n✔ One tab at a time. No distractions.\n✔ One task at a time. Full focus, deep work.\n✔ One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth.\nIt feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort.\nThey spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\n✔ Do fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.\n✔ Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.\n✔ Focus on quality over quantity.\nIronically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\n✔ How much progress I make on things that actually matter.\n✔ How much energy I have left at the end of the day.\n✔ How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.\nI stopped asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd started asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do less, but better?\u0026rdquo;\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\n✔ Instead of doing more, do less—strategically.\n✔ Instead of working harder, work on the right things.\n✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity.\nBecause the most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done.\nThey’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret.\nIt’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity-trap-why-doing-more-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductivity was about doing more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✔ More tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More efficiency.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More checkboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn’t constantly \u003cstrong\u003eoptimizing, planning, and squeezing every second\u003c/strong\u003e for maximum output, I was failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at first? \u003cstrong\u003eIt worked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting things done.

I’d see guys with thick, full beards and think, Yeah, that’s just not for me.\nIt wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:\n✔ I shave because I always have.\n✔ I’m just not a beard person.\nAnd then, one day\u0026hellip; I didn’t shave.\nThe Accidental Beard Experiment I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, I shall grow a beard!\nIt started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had more stubble than usual.\nNormally, this would have annoyed me. But this time?\nI let it stay.\nAt first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me. I\u0026rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, Who is this guy?\nThe itchy phase was real.\nThe awkward patchy phase was even more real.\nBut the strangest part?\nI kind of liked it.\nI started noticing little things:\nIt made me look older (or maybe just different). It changed the shape of my face. I kept catching myself stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher. And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a reminder that something was changing.\nWhy Growing a Beard Felt So… Different It’s funny how something as simple as not shaving can change the way you see yourself.\nI looked different. My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a real-life Instagram filter. I felt different. There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more deliberate. Like I had made a choice, even if that choice was just to\u0026hellip; not shave. Other people noticed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You look… more Italian now.\u0026rdquo; (That one made me laugh.) I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, when all I did was\u0026hellip; nothing.\nAnd every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.\nWhat I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing Growing a beard didn’t change my life.\nBut it did make me realize something important.\nSo many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults”—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.\nFor years, I thought:\n✔ I’m a clean-shaven guy.\n✔ Beards don’t suit me.\n✔ This is just how I look.\nAnd then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.\nIt made me wonder:\nHow many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?\nI’m not a morning person. (Or am I just used to staying up late?) I don’t like public speaking. (Or have I just never given it a real chance?) I’m not a beard guy. (Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?) It’s strange how something as simple as not shaving can make you question so much more.\nWill I Keep It? I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll shave it off next week.\nMaybe I’ll keep it longer.\nRight now, I’m just letting it be.\nNo expectations. No rules. Just curiosity.\nBut either way, this isn’t really about the beard.\nIt’s about realizing that sometimes, the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.\nAnd honestly? That’s worth exploring.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/i-never-thought-id-grow-a-beard/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been a \u003cstrong\u003ebeard guy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just \u003cstrong\u003ehappened\u003c/strong\u003e to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age.

Everything I do is digital.\nAnd yet, whenever I need to truly think, whenever I need to solve a problem, I reach for something ancient.\nPaper.\nYes, real, dead-tree, old-school paper. With an actual pen. No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.\nWhy Do I Do This? People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?\u0026rdquo;\nI tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.\nBut every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.\nWith paper, I can:\nThink freely without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications. Draw connections with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate. Physically slow down, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving. I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because it works.\nThe Problem with Digital Thinking I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:\nThey make everything too neat.\nTyping forces you into a linear thought process. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.\nBut real problem-solving? It’s messy.\nIt’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.\nDigital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.\nWhen I write on paper, I’m not editing as I think. I’m letting ideas collide, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.\nPaper is My Debugging Tool For some people, thinking happens on the keyboard.\nFor me, thinking happens with a pen.\nIt’s not just about notes—it’s about clarity. It’s about processing. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.\nBefore I write code, I write on paper. I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture. Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out. I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster. Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page. I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios. By the time I finally touch the keyboard, I already know what I’m doing.\nThe Takeaway People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job isn’t the newest or the most advanced—it’s just the one that works.\nNo productivity hack replaces thinking.\nNo app mimics messy creativity.\nNo digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.\nSo yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.\nBut also? Watch me solve problems faster than you.\nBecause in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues.

The features are great, but why is there a subscription for this? It’s perfect on iPhone, but the Windows version looks like it was built in 2009 and abandoned. It’s perfect on Windows, but the iPhone version syncs once every full moon. And just like that, the cycle continues.\nWhy Do I Do This to Myself? I know what you’re thinking:\n\u0026ldquo;Why not just pick one and move on?\u0026rdquo;\nBecause that’s what normal people do. But my brain doesn’t work that way.\nI need flow in my tools.

I can’t un-notice it.\nI have a zero-tolerance policy for inefficiency:\n✔ If an app takes more than two clicks to do something that should take one, it’s dead to me.\n✔ If it’s ugly or the design is inconsistent, I won’t use it, no matter how powerful it is.\n✔ If it’s perfect but has a monthly subscription, I will uninstall it on principle.\nI want my apps to feel invisible, like they don’t exist.

Windows apps are powerful, but most of them were designed by people who hate UI. The “cross-platform” apps? Usually the worst of both worlds.

I eliminate them.\nI’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale mission to find the absolute best—the one perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.\n✔ One backpack.\n✔ One pen.\n✔ One pencil.\n✔ One bathroom set.\nEverything I own must be the best, the most compact, the most portable.\nWhy? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.\n🔹 Not as objects, but as decisions.\nI don’t want five backpacks—I want one that does it all.\nI don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want one that feels perfect in my hand.\nI don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.\nThis isn’t just minimalism.\nIt’s ruthless optimization.\nThe Rules of the Game Finding The One is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.\n1️⃣ Compactness is king. If it’s too bulky, it’s out. Portability without sacrifice.\n2️⃣ One item, zero regrets. Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. This is my Excalibur.\n3️⃣ Quality over everything. If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. No disposable junk.\n4️⃣ No over-engineered nonsense. If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I don’t want it. Keep it simple, durable, and effective.\nThis isn’t about being cheap. It’s about investing in the best, once—and then never thinking about it again.\nThe Search is Brutal You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.\nFinding the one perfect item in any category means sifting through a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right options.\nThe best backpack? Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats. The best pen? Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream pretentious fountain pen guy. Found it. But wait—should I test one more? The best toothbrush? Yes, even this is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. Why is this so hard? Each decision is a battle. A war between function and obsession.\nAnd the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.\n❌ “This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”\n❌ “This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”\n❌ “This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”\nI fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make spreadsheets with pros and cons.\nYes, I’m that person.\nWhy I Love This Insanity Some people call it overthinking.\nI call it engineering my life for efficiency.\nBecause once I’ve chosen The One, I’m free.\n✅ No more switching.\n✅ No more rebuying.\n✅ No more second-guessing.\nJust one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.\nIt’s about reducing decision fatigue. It’s about knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me. It’s about portability, mobility, and adaptability.\nIt’s also about being prepared.\nI’ve moved across continents multiple times. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the freedom of traveling light and the nightmare of clutter.\nSo when the next big move happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.\n❌ No clutter.\n❌ No baggage.\n✅ Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.\nThe Final Boss Battle of Minimalism I’m not naive.\nI know The One doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.\nBut the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.\nIt’s about curating my life to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about choosing quality over quantity in every decision.\nSo if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.\nAnd when I finally find The One?\n✔ I’ll stop looking.\n✔ Until the next perfect version comes out. 😉\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pursuit-of-perfect-quest-for-ultimate-everything/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003cstrong\u003ecollect things\u003c/strong\u003e.

Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board. Timers? Useful—if I remember I set them. To-do lists? I write them, I admire them\u0026hellip; I never check them again. Productivity apps? I collect them like Pokémon. I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? None work if I forget to open them. Pomodoro? Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists. I’ve heard all the usual advice:\n\u0026ldquo;Just choose your priorities!\u0026rdquo; But everything feels important.\n\u0026ldquo;Use reminders!\u0026rdquo; Great idea—if I remember to set them.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?\u0026rdquo; Yes. I lost track of them too.\nIt’s not that I don’t try. I do. But my brain doesn’t follow the rules.\nAnd yet… I still get things done.\nHow I Actually Get Work Done I stopped looking for one perfect system—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of simple tricks and mental hacks to keep myself productive.\nOne task at a time. Multitasking? I quit that. If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing nothing. Writing everything down. My memory is unreliable, so I put everything in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it. The Two-Minute Rule. If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned. But the most important thing?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to use systems made for other people. I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.

I build things for the web. I write code.\nI understand how browsers work.\nAnd yet, somehow, choosing a default browser nearly broke me.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. It’s just a browser.\nA glorified tab holder. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. Freedom.\nOr so I thought.\nIn reality, every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.\nChrome – The original Chromium overlord. Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months? Also yes.\nBecause let’s be real—the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/browser-wars-journey-to-least-annoying-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m a software developer.

Push through resistance. Be disciplined.\nI told myself, “Just do it. No excuses.”\nAnd for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.\nBut then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.\nAnd every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.\nThen I learned something that changed everything:\nWe don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Trying Harder\u0026rdquo; Never Works Think about this:\nTwo people are offered a cigarette.\nThe first person says, “No thanks, I’m trying to quit.” The second person says, “No thanks, I don’t smoke.” The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.\nThe first person is using willpower—constantly resisting. The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted. That’s why most habits fail.\nWe focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.\nThe Identity-Based Approach to Change Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.\nEvery action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.\nIf I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer. If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges. I had to stop seeing habits as things I do and start seeing them as things that define who I am.\nHow I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change I started with small identity shifts:\nInstead of “I should exercise more,” I tell myself “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.” Instead of “I need to focus better,” I remind myself “I’m someone who works with deep focus.” Instead of “I need to stop procrastinating,” I say “I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.” At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:\nThe brain hates cognitive dissonance.\nWhen you tell yourself you are something, you subconsciously start acting like it.\nIf I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day. If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes. If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character. It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.\nThe Difference Between Trying and Being I used to say:\n“I’m trying to exercise more.” “I’m trying to focus better.” “I’m trying to wake up earlier.” Now I say:\n“I’m a person who moves every day.” “I’m someone who works with focus.” “I’m the kind of person who gets up early.” The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.\nAnd identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.\nThe Takeaway Willpower is unreliable.\nMotivation fades.\nBut identity sticks.\nIf you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.\nStart with who you are.\nWant to read more? Become a reader. Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health. Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it. Because the truth is:\nWe don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.\nChange who you are, and the actions will follow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-struggle-to-change-simple-fix-that-works/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think change was about willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder.

Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/motivation-myth-why-waiting-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I waited for \u003cstrong\u003emotivation to strike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductive people\u003c/strong\u003e had some kind of \u003cstrong\u003emagical drive\u003c/strong\u003e I didn’t.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat one day, I’d wake up \u003cstrong\u003efull of energy\u003c/strong\u003e, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects \u003cstrong\u003ewithout procrastinating\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day \u003cstrong\u003enever came.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it never \u003cem\u003ewill.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here’s the truth:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck"},{"content":"Some people think changing your mind is a weakness—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That certainty equals strength and doubt makes you unreliable.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. Not because I’m indecisive, but because I’m learning.\nThe Art of Arguing With Yourself It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly\u0026hellip; doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us \u0026ldquo;won.\u0026rdquo;\nNot because we’re trying to be \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being \u0026ldquo;consistent.\u0026rdquo; But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re frozen in time.\nPeople who adapt, question, and rethink? They’re evolving.\nAnd that means being willing to say,\n\u0026ldquo;I was wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I learned something new.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nIt means embracing doubt, curiosity, and growth.\nThe Takeaway People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what.\nBut real strength? Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about:\nBeing curious enough to question yourself. Being humble enough to admit when you’re wrong. Being smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth. So the next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.\nTake it as proof that you’re evolving.\nBecause the strongest minds?\nThey’re the ones that never stop upgrading.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome people think \u003cstrong\u003echanging your mind is a weakness\u003c/strong\u003e—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever.

Classic exhaustion, right?\nSo I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.\nBut no matter what I did, the fatigue never went away.\nI blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, \u0026ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I realized something.\nI wasn’t just physically exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.\nAnd no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.\nBecause we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.\nThe 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them) 1. Mental Exhaustion (The Overloaded Brain) Too many tabs open (in your browser and your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.\nSymptoms: Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination. 2. Emotional Exhaustion (The Feeling Drain) When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.\nSymptoms: Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap. 3. Creative Exhaustion (The Empty Tank) The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in \u0026lsquo;output mode\u0026rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.\nSymptoms: Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking. 4. Social Exhaustion (The People Drain) It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.\nSymptoms: Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings. 5. Sensory Exhaustion (The Overstimulation Overload) Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.\nSymptoms: Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness. Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest) Here’s the problem: we treat them all the same way.\nMental exhaustion? We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive. Emotional exhaustion? We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them. Creative exhaustion? We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it. Social exhaustion? We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue. Sensory exhaustion? We \u0026ldquo;relax\u0026rdquo; by staring at another screen. We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.\nBut if you don’t know what kind of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.\nSo Here’s How I’m Fixing It Instead of \u0026ldquo;resting\u0026rdquo; in a generic way, I’m resting with purpose.\nI match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.\n1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset Deep work in short bursts – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching. Digital decluttering – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling. Brain dump journaling – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space. 2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue Fewer choices – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to. Emotional boundaries – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions. Journaling – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up. 3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration Consume good input – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things. Change of scenery – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective. Play – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids. 4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude Meaningful connections only – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk. Scheduled alone time – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions. Boundaries – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel. 5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise Digital detox – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode. Minimalist workspace – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload. Silence and darkness – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses. The Takeaway We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about not sleeping enough.\nBut the real question isn’t \u0026ldquo;Am I tired?\u0026rdquo;—it’s \u0026ldquo;What kind of tired am I?\u0026rdquo;\nOnce you figure that out?\nYou can finally start recharging the right way.\nAnd you might just find that you’re not broken.\nYou were just resting wrong.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-youre-always-tired-not-just-about-sleep/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I thought I was just \u003cem\u003etired.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time.

It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reshape them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not that things were better. It’s that we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo\u0026hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that in my life today. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.\nSo next time you find yourself saying, “Things were better back then”, stop and ask:\nOr maybe\u0026hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?\nMaybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how distracted, rushed, and stressed we’ve become.\nMaybe the best days aren’t behind us.\nMaybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver caught yourself thinking, \u003cem\u003e“Things were better back then”\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just \u003cem\u003efelt\u003c/em\u003e different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do this all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\nI remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being \u003cem\u003edisconnected.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)"},{"content":"I don’t know why, but finding the right backpack feels like a life quest—like I’m a video game character on an endless side mission.\nI’ve owned plenty of backpacks.

No organization, just one giant pocket where everything disappears.\nWant your keys? Hope you enjoy an archaeological dig.\nIt’s always the same scenario:\nI’m in a rush.

And when it breaks, it does so with the dramatic flair of a telenovela character. I also break things on purpose—because the best way to fix something is to first see how it falls apart.\nBy day, I’m a PHP backend engineer, making sure systems don’t implode (or at least fail gracefully). I work remotely from Brooklyn 🗽, where my bugs come with complimentary fixes—or at least a very convincing explanation.\nBy night, I trade in debugging for Dad Logic™ (which, let’s be honest, never works 🤷‍♂️) and a never-ending quest to impress my wife with the tech gadgets she never asked for.\n🌍 A Life Between Two Worlds Born in New York, raised in Italy, and now back in the city that never sleeps, my life has been a series of loops—like a recursive function that just won’t quit.\nI didn’t follow a straight path. After spending nearly a decade wrestling with a computer science degree that refused to cooperate, I built my own way forward. Instead of perfect grades, I gained a problem-solving mindset that helps me tackle challenges from unexpected angles.\nAnd while my Italian roots run deep (especially when it comes to good food 🍝), my New York grit means I refuse to settle for anything less than perfection.\n💻 What I Do I love building, fixing, and optimizing—whether it’s backend systems, workflows, or my workspace setup that I will never stop tweaking.\nMy work revolves around:\n✔ PHP Development – Making things work behind the scenes.\n✔ Problem-Solving – Debugging what others avoid.\n✔ System Optimization – Streamlining, automating, improving.\nBut beyond coding, I’m always learning, exploring, and experimenting—from digital minimalism (a great excuse to buy better gadgets) to productivity hacks (that I sometimes ignore).\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Life Outside Code When I’m not deep in terminal commands, I’m:\nBeing a dad – Raising two amazing kids: one who questions everything 🤔, and one who ensures I never sleep.

I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.\nAnd slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:\nThis tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.\nHe Tasted the World — Literally Babies have 30,000 taste buds. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s three times more than adults.\nWhen my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if you could taste shapes, or feel sounds.\nSome researchers believe that babies might experience synesthesia early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally taste textures or feel sounds before those brain connections settle down.\nHonestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.\nHe Saw Things I’ll Never See Again At one point, my son could recognize every human face — no matter the ethnicity. Even monkeys. Yes, monkeys.\nBut then came perceptual narrowing: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, “We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”\nNow he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.\nFor a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.\nAnd we call adults smart?\nHe Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked vision and touch.\nThis is called peripersonal space awareness, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.\nBy eight months, babies expect sensory outcomes — and are surprised when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.\nThat’s if-then logic, built in.\nAnd unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.\nHe Could Hear Every Language on Earth Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones we don’t even speak.\nHindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.\nBut as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.\nThis is called phonetic narrowing. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.\nMeanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.\nHis Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t. There’s this old myth that babies lose the stepping reflex by 2 months. Not true.\nWhat actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.\nIn fact, one study showed that babies who \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the stepping reflex started doing it again… in water, where their legs were lighter.\nSo yes — my son had the walking software pre-installed, he was just waiting for the driver update.\nHe Knows If You\u0026rsquo;re a Good Person Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.\nThey even prefer nice puppets over mean ones. Without being told.\nThat’s proto-moral reasoning. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.\nIf my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.\nHe Does Math. The Impossible Kind. If you show a baby a simple math \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.\nThat’s because they know something’s off.\nIt’s called number sense.\nNo formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.\nIt’s basically unit testing for logic — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.\nBabbling = Precompiled Language When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.\nHe’s compiling syntax.\nStudies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will babble with their hands. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.\nSo language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about brains. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.\nHe’s not learning language. He’s already running the beta release.\nHis Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids Here’s what’s running during nap time:\nNeural pruning REM-driven memory consolidation Cortisol modulation Synaptic reorganization Night mode updates Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.\nIt’s unsupervised machine learning, every night.\nWhich is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.\nFinal Thoughts Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.\nBut none of it — none of it — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.\nHe’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.\nHe’s not just smart.\nHe’s smarter than ChatGPT.\nAnd when I ask him something…\nHe looks me in the eye…\n…and says: \u0026ldquo;Banana.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt\"\u003eMy Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was smart.

No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a Content Management System (CMS) feels like.\nI should know. I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.\nFor me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.\nSo, What Exactly Is a CMS? Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically the control center of a website. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content without touching a single line of code.\nThink of it like a kitchen. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.\nWithout a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. It’s not pretty.\nWhy Should You Care? Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).\nA painfully slow website (the kind that makes you question all your life choices). Articles impossible to find (why is the latest election update buried under \u0026ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil\u0026rdquo;?). A paywall that feels like a trap (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand). A good CMS, though? It keeps everything fast, smooth, and user-friendly. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists actually get paid.\nAnd that’s exactly what we do at BLOX Digital.\nWhy BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT) At BLOX Digital, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build the CMS platform.\nPowering 2,000+ news sites across the U.S. Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year Helping media companies stay profitable while keeping journalism accessible How? BLOX CMS – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes. BLOX Audience+ – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense. BLOX YieldUp – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess. But the thing I’m really excited about?\nBLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.\nReal-time collaboration – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism. AI-powered tools – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content. One-click publishing to multiple platforms – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place. A modern, intuitive interface – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.\nEarly partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.\nThe Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People. You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.\nGuy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:\n“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”\nBasically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.\nThey see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because \u0026ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.\nThe Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.\nThat’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.\nMy work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.\nNewsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.\nThat’s why BLOX NXT matters.

And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.\nWell, let me tell you—it is. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.\nLet’s get into it.\n1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.\nJPG compresses images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little\u0026hellip; off.\nPNG, on the other hand, keeps everything. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.\nSo, if you care about keeping things crisp, PNG is your best friend.\n2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It. Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do transparency.\nPNG? Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.\nThis is huge if you’re working with logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.\nOr, you know, just use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache.\n3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into blurry, blocky nonsense. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.\nIf you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, stick with PNG. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.\nAnd no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t completely fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.\n4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression at work.\nPNG keeps all the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”\nIf you’re working on art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you like your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.\n5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality gets worse.\nPNG? Doesn’t budge.\nThis is huge if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.\nAlso, if you’re archiving old photos, PNG is the way to go. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, “Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”\nBut Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better? Look, JPG isn’t evil. It’s just… situational.\nIf you’re dealing with big photos and need to save space, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that don’t need to be perfect.\nBut if you’re working with logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine, PNG is the move.\nFinal Thoughts So next time you’re about to hit \u0026ldquo;Save As,\u0026rdquo; ask yourself: Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later? If the answer to any of those is yes, PNG all the way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: \u003cstrong\u003ePNG or JPG?\u003c/strong\u003e And suddenly, you pause.

This is the one?\nBecause for the longest time, I didn’t.\nMoving to New York, I figured finding good bread would be easy.\nI mean, it’s NYC! Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.\nBut Italian-style bread? That was a different story.\nToo Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless? The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:\n1️⃣ Too soft—like, pillow soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.\n2️⃣ Too sweet—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.\n3️⃣ Too tasteless—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite\u0026hellip; nothing. Just air and disappointment.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the prices.\nArtisan bakeries? Amazing.\nBut unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.\nA Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer) Enter: My Wife, The Genius.\nLast Christmas, B (my wife) surprised me with a bread machine.\nHonestly? I wasn’t expecting it.\nI’d casually (let’s say \u0026ldquo;casually\u0026rdquo;) complained:\nHow expensive good bread was. How nothing tasted quite right. How I wished I could just make my own. Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom! Bread machine under the tree.\n(I love you, B ❤️)\nNow, I’d love to say my first loaf came out perfect.\nThat I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created a masterpiece.\nBut let’s be real—it was a disaster.\nDense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency.\n(Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.)\nTurns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.\nBread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba) In Italy, we don’t have a special “bread flour” on supermarket shelves.\nInstead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure.\nSimple, right?\nWell, try finding Manitoba flour in New York.\nI dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.\nEventually, I cracked the code:\n✔ Just buy bread flour. Problem solved.\nBut then I had another discovery—one that changed everything:\nSemolina: The Secret Weapon The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing.\n✔ The crust had that snap.\n✔ The inside had more flavor.\n✔ The whole loaf just felt… right.\nNot easy to find, but totally worth the effort.\nAnd that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements.\nI love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better.\nMaybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows? Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda. Let’s talk cost.\nMaking bread at home isn’t free.\nGood flour isn’t cheap.\nAnd yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).\nBut\u0026hellip;\n✔ Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? Nope.\n✔ Is it way better than supermarket bread? Absolutely.\n✔ Does it take more than four minutes of effort? Not really.\nFour minutes to throw ingredients in, press a button, and then just wait.\nThat’s it.\n✔ No kneading.\n✔ No babysitting dough.\n✔ Just a little patience.\nAnd the best part? My house smells like a bakery every time.\nThe Never-Ending Bread Journey So here I am, an Italian guy in NYC, still tweaking, learning, experimenting—\nBut finally—finally—happy with my bread.\nAnd if I ever move again (hey, it’s happened before), at least I know one thing:\nGood bread isn’t something you find.

No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.\nAt first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… until it didn’t.\nJekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:\nSlow build times – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee. Ruby dependencies – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon. Outdated themes – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012. I tried alternatives:\nGhost – Overkill for a simple blog. WordPress – Too bloated. Eleventy – Cool, but required too much setup. Pelican – Python-based, but didn’t click with me. Then I found Hugo—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.\nWhy I Stuck with GitHub Pages I kept everything on GitHub Pages because:\nIt’s free – No hosting costs. Free is always good. Automatic updates – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly. Easy domain linking – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle. No maintenance – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish. Version control built-in – I can roll back changes if I break something (which happens often). With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup) Unlike Jekyll, which requires bundle install and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.\nOn macOS:\nbrew install hugo\nOn Windows: Download it from Hugo’s GitHub releases and add it to your PATH.\nOn Linux:\nsudo apt install hugo\nTo verify the installation:\nhugo version\rThat’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.\nStep 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…) At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s content/posts/ folder, and everything would work.\nIt didn’t.\nWhat Broke? Folder structure – Jekyll stores posts in _posts/, but Hugo expects them in content/posts/. Front matter differences – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON. Permalinks – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently. To move the posts:\nmkdir -p content/posts\rmv _posts/* content/posts/\rThen, I had to clean up the front matter:\nfind content/posts -type f -name \u0026quot;*.\rmd\u0026quot; -exec sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \\;\rThat was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… until it isn’t.\nStep 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making) I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:\nMainroad – Clean, but too plain. Anubis – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted. Hello-Friend – Nice, but missing features I needed. PaperMod – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak. Installing PaperMod was simple:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod\rThen, I updated config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot;\rFor now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.\nStep 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken) I ran:\nhugo server -D\r…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.\nWhat Went Wrong? Jekyll’s /assets/ folder didn’t move – I had to copy it manually. Relative links broke – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll. Markdown formatting was stricter – Sloppy formatting? Not happening. After fixing those, my site finally worked.\nStep 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…) Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.\nRun Hugo’s build command\nhugo\rThis generates a public/ folder with the static files.\nPush to GitHub\ncd public\rgit initgit add .git commit -m \u0026quot;Deploy Hugo site\u0026quot;\rgit push origin main\rAt first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up GitHub Actions to automate everything.\nStep 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone) Enable Dark Mode [params] defaultTheme = \u0026quot;dark\u0026quot;\rEnable Search [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]\rCustomize Sidebar Profile [params.profileMode] enabled = true title = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;images/profile.jpg\u0026quot;\rEvery time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.\nWas It Worth It? Hugo is fast – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait. No more Ruby dependencies – No bundle exec, no errors, no wasted time. PaperMod works out of the box – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization. What I’d Do Differently Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually. Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once. Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down. Why I’ll Keep Blogging This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.\nA personal blog is like a journal – It helps me organize my thoughts. It’s my escape from social media – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen. It’s mine, forever – No company can shadowban or de-platform me. I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.\nWhat I do know is this:\nI like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet.

But ask me where I saved that important note from last week? Gone. Ask me what I was about to do five seconds ago? No idea.\nMy brain has this incredible ability to cling to completely useless information while ruthlessly discarding the things I actually need.\nI’ve spent years searching for a way to keep my thoughts, projects, and tasks organized. I tried:\n✔ Sticky notes (good luck finding them when I actually need them\u0026hellip; they vanish into another dimension).\n✔ To-do list apps (too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week).\n✔ Google Docs (a black hole where ideas go to die).\n✔ My own memory (don’t even ask).\nNothing worked.\nThen I stumbled upon Notion, and suddenly, my brain had a backup system.\nWhy Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed) I’ve always been skeptical of “all-in-one” productivity tools.\nEvery app promises to be the last one you’ll ever need—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think.\nNotion is the first one that actually adapts to me.\nIt’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once. But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a blank canvas, and I decide the rules. The free version is actually good. Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using a relic from 2010. I can publish and share pages instantly. No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done. I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost. Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—they all have a home now. And somehow, I can actually find them when I need them. Before Notion, my workflow was a mess.\nNotes buried in random text files. Ideas scattered in Google Keep, which I’d forget existed. Tasks floating in my head, patiently waiting to be forgotten. Now? Everything is in one place. Exactly where I expect it to be.\nIt’s like having my own personal knowledge base, and for the first time, I actually trust my system.\nWhat About the Offline Mode? Yeah, I know—Notion doesn’t work offline.\nFor most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? It doesn’t matter.\nI work online all the time. My job as a developer is remote. My files live in the cloud. My meetings are on video calls.\nThe only time I’d need offline notes is if I were stuck in a cabin with no internet—and at that point, I have bigger problems than note-taking.\nLike figuring out how to survive without Stack Overflow.\nFor my actual, daily reality, Notion’s always-online approach isn’t a limitation.\nIt’s just how I already work.\nThe Takeaway I didn’t think I needed Notion.\nI thought I just needed to be more disciplined or find the “right” system to organize my thoughts. I assumed I was just bad at remembering things, and that was that.\nBut now? I can’t imagine functioning without it.\nIf you’ve ever felt like your thoughts are scattered across a dozen places, if you struggle to remember things you actually need, if you’ve tried every productivity tool and nothing stuck—\nNotion might be exactly what your brain has been waiting for.\nAnd unlike my real brain, it actually remembers things.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/notion-external-brain-that-works-for-me/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I’ve been at war with \u003cstrong\u003emy own memory\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m great at solving problems, debugging complex code, and figuring out tricky logic flows.

No.\nHere’s what actually happens.\nStep 1: The Grand Vision (\u0026ldquo;I know exactly how to do this.\u0026rdquo;) You get the ticket. You think, Oh, this is simple.\nYou crack your knuckles. Open your editor. Start typing with confidence.\nYou’re in the zone. The code is flowing. You are an unstoppable force. A coding genius. You should write a book about this.\nStep 2: The First Run (\u0026ldquo;Why is it broken?\u0026rdquo;) You confidently hit run.\nImmediate error.\nOkay, no problem. A minor fix. You run it again.\nDifferent error.\nYou frown. Maybe you mistyped something? You check the function names. Everything looks correct.\nRun it again.\nNow it’s really broken.\nThis is the moment you realize: You have no idea what you’re doing.\nStep 3: The Google Phase (\u0026ldquo;Surely someone has solved this before.\u0026rdquo;) You open Google. You type something completely ridiculous, like:\n\u0026ldquo;PHP array error help please what is happening\u0026rdquo;\nYou find a Stack Overflow thread from 2012. Someone had a similar problem. The top answer is:\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried restarting your computer?\u0026rdquo;\nYou scroll down. Another answer looks promising. You copy and paste the code without reading it.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nStep 4: The Deep Spiral (\u0026ldquo;I have made a terrible mistake.\u0026rdquo;) You start adding random print statements.\nYou go deeper into Stack Overflow. You start reading answers from people who sound like they barely know what they’re doing—but at this point, you’re desperate.\nYou begin questioning your life choices.\nMaybe I should’ve been a chef? People always need food. Nobody ever asks a steak why it’s not iterating through an array properly.\nStep 5: The Accidental Fix (\u0026ldquo;Wait\u0026hellip; what?\u0026rdquo;) You change one tiny thing—maybe a missing semicolon, maybe a different variable name—and suddenly…\nIt works.\nYou don’t know why. You don’t care.\nYou immediately push the fix before it breaks again.\nStep 6: The \u0026ldquo;Good Enough\u0026rdquo; Phase (\u0026ldquo;I’ll refactor this later.\u0026rdquo;) You know the code is messy. You know future-you will hate this.\nBut you tell yourself:\n\u0026ldquo;I’ll clean it up later.\u0026rdquo;\nYou never do.\nStep 7: The Code Review Horror (\u0026ldquo;What was I thinking?\u0026rdquo;) Two weeks later, someone reviews your code.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, why is there a console.log('WHY IS THIS BROKEN') in here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is this function name supposed to be fixThisPleaseFinal_v3()?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you… copy this from Stack Overflow?\u0026rdquo;\nYou avoid eye contact.

It worked.\nI was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.\nBut then something strange happened.\nDespite all my so-called productivity, I felt like I was going nowhere.\n❌ Busy, but not fulfilled.\n❌ Efficient, but not effective.\n❌ Always working, but never actually moving forward.\nAnd that’s when I realized: The way we think about productivity is broken.\nThe False Promise of “Getting More Done” Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a lie:\n🛑 That the key to success is efficiency.\n🛑 That if we just optimize our time perfectly, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.\nBut here’s the truth:\nProductivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the right things done. And if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\n1️⃣ You feel overwhelmed. Too much to do, not enough time.\n2️⃣ You try to optimize. Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.\n3️⃣ You get efficient\u0026hellip; at the wrong things. Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually matters.\n4️⃣ You stay stuck in a loop of busyness. Always “doing,” never really progressing.\nThis is the scary part:\nProductivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion. And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.\nI was checking boxes but not moving forward.\nI was working hard but not working smart.\nI was busy—but not productive.\nThe Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition I used to ask myself:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, I ask a better question:\n\u0026ldquo;What can I remove?\u0026rdquo;\nReal productivity isn’t about adding more tasks.\nIt’s about:\n✔ Eliminating distractions.\n✔ Cutting useless work.\n✔ Focusing on what actually moves the needle.\nHere’s how I flipped my mindset:\n1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.\nIt felt productive, but in reality? It was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort.\nBut most of us spend time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nI ask:\n✔ What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?\n✔ What can I cut without any real consequence?\nThen, I ruthlessly focus on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking.\nBut multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time.\nNow, I do the opposite:\n✔ One tab at a time. No distractions.\n✔ One task at a time. Full focus, deep work.\n✔ One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth.\nIt feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort.\nThey spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\n✔ Do fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.\n✔ Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.\n✔ Focus on quality over quantity.\nIronically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\n✔ How much progress I make on things that actually matter.\n✔ How much energy I have left at the end of the day.\n✔ How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.\nI stopped asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd started asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do less, but better?\u0026rdquo;\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\n✔ Instead of doing more, do less—strategically.\n✔ Instead of working harder, work on the right things.\n✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity.\nBecause the most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done.\nThey’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret.\nIt’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity-trap-why-doing-more-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductivity was about doing more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✔ More tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More efficiency.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More checkboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn’t constantly \u003cstrong\u003eoptimizing, planning, and squeezing every second\u003c/strong\u003e for maximum output, I was failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at first? \u003cstrong\u003eIt worked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting things done.

I’d see guys with thick, full beards and think, Yeah, that’s just not for me.\nIt wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:\n✔ I shave because I always have.\n✔ I’m just not a beard person.\nAnd then, one day\u0026hellip; I didn’t shave.\nThe Accidental Beard Experiment I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, I shall grow a beard!\nIt started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had more stubble than usual.\nNormally, this would have annoyed me. But this time?\nI let it stay.\nAt first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me. I\u0026rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, Who is this guy?\nThe itchy phase was real.\nThe awkward patchy phase was even more real.\nBut the strangest part?\nI kind of liked it.\nI started noticing little things:\nIt made me look older (or maybe just different). It changed the shape of my face. I kept catching myself stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher. And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a reminder that something was changing.\nWhy Growing a Beard Felt So… Different It’s funny how something as simple as not shaving can change the way you see yourself.\nI looked different. My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a real-life Instagram filter. I felt different. There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more deliberate. Like I had made a choice, even if that choice was just to\u0026hellip; not shave. Other people noticed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You look… more Italian now.\u0026rdquo; (That one made me laugh.) I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, when all I did was\u0026hellip; nothing.\nAnd every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.\nWhat I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing Growing a beard didn’t change my life.\nBut it did make me realize something important.\nSo many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults”—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.\nFor years, I thought:\n✔ I’m a clean-shaven guy.\n✔ Beards don’t suit me.\n✔ This is just how I look.\nAnd then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.\nIt made me wonder:\nHow many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?\nI’m not a morning person. (Or am I just used to staying up late?) I don’t like public speaking. (Or have I just never given it a real chance?) I’m not a beard guy. (Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?) It’s strange how something as simple as not shaving can make you question so much more.\nWill I Keep It? I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll shave it off next week.\nMaybe I’ll keep it longer.\nRight now, I’m just letting it be.\nNo expectations. No rules. Just curiosity.\nBut either way, this isn’t really about the beard.\nIt’s about realizing that sometimes, the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.\nAnd honestly? That’s worth exploring.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/i-never-thought-id-grow-a-beard/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been a \u003cstrong\u003ebeard guy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just \u003cstrong\u003ehappened\u003c/strong\u003e to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age.

Everything I do is digital.\nAnd yet, whenever I need to truly think, whenever I need to solve a problem, I reach for something ancient.\nPaper.\nYes, real, dead-tree, old-school paper. With an actual pen. No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.\nWhy Do I Do This? People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?\u0026rdquo;\nI tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.\nBut every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.\nWith paper, I can:\nThink freely without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications. Draw connections with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate. Physically slow down, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving. I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because it works.\nThe Problem with Digital Thinking I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:\nThey make everything too neat.\nTyping forces you into a linear thought process. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.\nBut real problem-solving? It’s messy.\nIt’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.\nDigital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.\nWhen I write on paper, I’m not editing as I think. I’m letting ideas collide, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.\nPaper is My Debugging Tool For some people, thinking happens on the keyboard.\nFor me, thinking happens with a pen.\nIt’s not just about notes—it’s about clarity. It’s about processing. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.\nBefore I write code, I write on paper. I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture. Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out. I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster. Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page. I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios. By the time I finally touch the keyboard, I already know what I’m doing.\nThe Takeaway People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job isn’t the newest or the most advanced—it’s just the one that works.\nNo productivity hack replaces thinking.\nNo app mimics messy creativity.\nNo digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.\nSo yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.\nBut also? Watch me solve problems faster than you.\nBecause in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues.

The features are great, but why is there a subscription for this? It’s perfect on iPhone, but the Windows version looks like it was built in 2009 and abandoned. It’s perfect on Windows, but the iPhone version syncs once every full moon. And just like that, the cycle continues.\nWhy Do I Do This to Myself? I know what you’re thinking:\n\u0026ldquo;Why not just pick one and move on?\u0026rdquo;\nBecause that’s what normal people do. But my brain doesn’t work that way.\nI need flow in my tools.

I can’t un-notice it.\nI have a zero-tolerance policy for inefficiency:\n✔ If an app takes more than two clicks to do something that should take one, it’s dead to me.\n✔ If it’s ugly or the design is inconsistent, I won’t use it, no matter how powerful it is.\n✔ If it’s perfect but has a monthly subscription, I will uninstall it on principle.\nI want my apps to feel invisible, like they don’t exist.

Windows apps are powerful, but most of them were designed by people who hate UI. The “cross-platform” apps? Usually the worst of both worlds.

I eliminate them.\nI’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale mission to find the absolute best—the one perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.\n✔ One backpack.\n✔ One pen.\n✔ One pencil.\n✔ One bathroom set.\nEverything I own must be the best, the most compact, the most portable.\nWhy? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.\n🔹 Not as objects, but as decisions.\nI don’t want five backpacks—I want one that does it all.\nI don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want one that feels perfect in my hand.\nI don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.\nThis isn’t just minimalism.\nIt’s ruthless optimization.\nThe Rules of the Game Finding The One is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.\n1️⃣ Compactness is king. If it’s too bulky, it’s out. Portability without sacrifice.\n2️⃣ One item, zero regrets. Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. This is my Excalibur.\n3️⃣ Quality over everything. If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. No disposable junk.\n4️⃣ No over-engineered nonsense. If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I don’t want it. Keep it simple, durable, and effective.\nThis isn’t about being cheap. It’s about investing in the best, once—and then never thinking about it again.\nThe Search is Brutal You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.\nFinding the one perfect item in any category means sifting through a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right options.\nThe best backpack? Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats. The best pen? Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream pretentious fountain pen guy. Found it. But wait—should I test one more? The best toothbrush? Yes, even this is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. Why is this so hard? Each decision is a battle. A war between function and obsession.\nAnd the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.\n❌ “This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”\n❌ “This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”\n❌ “This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”\nI fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make spreadsheets with pros and cons.\nYes, I’m that person.\nWhy I Love This Insanity Some people call it overthinking.\nI call it engineering my life for efficiency.\nBecause once I’ve chosen The One, I’m free.\n✅ No more switching.\n✅ No more rebuying.\n✅ No more second-guessing.\nJust one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.\nIt’s about reducing decision fatigue. It’s about knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me. It’s about portability, mobility, and adaptability.\nIt’s also about being prepared.\nI’ve moved across continents multiple times. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the freedom of traveling light and the nightmare of clutter.\nSo when the next big move happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.\n❌ No clutter.\n❌ No baggage.\n✅ Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.\nThe Final Boss Battle of Minimalism I’m not naive.\nI know The One doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.\nBut the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.\nIt’s about curating my life to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about choosing quality over quantity in every decision.\nSo if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.\nAnd when I finally find The One?\n✔ I’ll stop looking.\n✔ Until the next perfect version comes out. 😉\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pursuit-of-perfect-quest-for-ultimate-everything/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003cstrong\u003ecollect things\u003c/strong\u003e.

Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board. Timers? Useful—if I remember I set them. To-do lists? I write them, I admire them\u0026hellip; I never check them again. Productivity apps? I collect them like Pokémon. I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? None work if I forget to open them. Pomodoro? Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists. I’ve heard all the usual advice:\n\u0026ldquo;Just choose your priorities!\u0026rdquo; But everything feels important.\n\u0026ldquo;Use reminders!\u0026rdquo; Great idea—if I remember to set them.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?\u0026rdquo; Yes. I lost track of them too.\nIt’s not that I don’t try. I do. But my brain doesn’t follow the rules.\nAnd yet… I still get things done.\nHow I Actually Get Work Done I stopped looking for one perfect system—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of simple tricks and mental hacks to keep myself productive.\nOne task at a time. Multitasking? I quit that. If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing nothing. Writing everything down. My memory is unreliable, so I put everything in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it. The Two-Minute Rule. If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned. But the most important thing?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to use systems made for other people. I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.

I build things for the web. I write code.\nI understand how browsers work.\nAnd yet, somehow, choosing a default browser nearly broke me.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. It’s just a browser.\nA glorified tab holder. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. Freedom.\nOr so I thought.\nIn reality, every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.\nChrome – The original Chromium overlord. Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months? Also yes.\nBecause let’s be real—the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/browser-wars-journey-to-least-annoying-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m a software developer.

Push through resistance. Be disciplined.\nI told myself, “Just do it. No excuses.”\nAnd for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.\nBut then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.\nAnd every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.\nThen I learned something that changed everything:\nWe don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Trying Harder\u0026rdquo; Never Works Think about this:\nTwo people are offered a cigarette.\nThe first person says, “No thanks, I’m trying to quit.” The second person says, “No thanks, I don’t smoke.” The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.\nThe first person is using willpower—constantly resisting. The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted. That’s why most habits fail.\nWe focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.\nThe Identity-Based Approach to Change Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.\nEvery action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.\nIf I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer. If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges. I had to stop seeing habits as things I do and start seeing them as things that define who I am.\nHow I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change I started with small identity shifts:\nInstead of “I should exercise more,” I tell myself “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.” Instead of “I need to focus better,” I remind myself “I’m someone who works with deep focus.” Instead of “I need to stop procrastinating,” I say “I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.” At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:\nThe brain hates cognitive dissonance.\nWhen you tell yourself you are something, you subconsciously start acting like it.\nIf I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day. If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes. If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character. It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.\nThe Difference Between Trying and Being I used to say:\n“I’m trying to exercise more.” “I’m trying to focus better.” “I’m trying to wake up earlier.” Now I say:\n“I’m a person who moves every day.” “I’m someone who works with focus.” “I’m the kind of person who gets up early.” The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.\nAnd identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.\nThe Takeaway Willpower is unreliable.\nMotivation fades.\nBut identity sticks.\nIf you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.\nStart with who you are.\nWant to read more? Become a reader. Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health. Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it. Because the truth is:\nWe don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.\nChange who you are, and the actions will follow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-struggle-to-change-simple-fix-that-works/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think change was about willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder.

Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/motivation-myth-why-waiting-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I waited for \u003cstrong\u003emotivation to strike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductive people\u003c/strong\u003e had some kind of \u003cstrong\u003emagical drive\u003c/strong\u003e I didn’t.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat one day, I’d wake up \u003cstrong\u003efull of energy\u003c/strong\u003e, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects \u003cstrong\u003ewithout procrastinating\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day \u003cstrong\u003enever came.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it never \u003cem\u003ewill.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here’s the truth:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck"},{"content":"Some people think changing your mind is a weakness—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That certainty equals strength and doubt makes you unreliable.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. Not because I’m indecisive, but because I’m learning.\nThe Art of Arguing With Yourself It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly\u0026hellip; doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us \u0026ldquo;won.\u0026rdquo;\nNot because we’re trying to be \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being \u0026ldquo;consistent.\u0026rdquo; But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re frozen in time.\nPeople who adapt, question, and rethink? They’re evolving.\nAnd that means being willing to say,\n\u0026ldquo;I was wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I learned something new.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nIt means embracing doubt, curiosity, and growth.\nThe Takeaway People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what.\nBut real strength? Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about:\nBeing curious enough to question yourself. Being humble enough to admit when you’re wrong. Being smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth. So the next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.\nTake it as proof that you’re evolving.\nBecause the strongest minds?\nThey’re the ones that never stop upgrading.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome people think \u003cstrong\u003echanging your mind is a weakness\u003c/strong\u003e—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever.

Classic exhaustion, right?\nSo I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.\nBut no matter what I did, the fatigue never went away.\nI blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, \u0026ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I realized something.\nI wasn’t just physically exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.\nAnd no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.\nBecause we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.\nThe 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them) 1. Mental Exhaustion (The Overloaded Brain) Too many tabs open (in your browser and your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.\nSymptoms: Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination. 2. Emotional Exhaustion (The Feeling Drain) When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.\nSymptoms: Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap. 3. Creative Exhaustion (The Empty Tank) The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in \u0026lsquo;output mode\u0026rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.\nSymptoms: Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking. 4. Social Exhaustion (The People Drain) It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.\nSymptoms: Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings. 5. Sensory Exhaustion (The Overstimulation Overload) Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.\nSymptoms: Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness. Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest) Here’s the problem: we treat them all the same way.\nMental exhaustion? We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive. Emotional exhaustion? We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them. Creative exhaustion? We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it. Social exhaustion? We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue. Sensory exhaustion? We \u0026ldquo;relax\u0026rdquo; by staring at another screen. We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.\nBut if you don’t know what kind of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.\nSo Here’s How I’m Fixing It Instead of \u0026ldquo;resting\u0026rdquo; in a generic way, I’m resting with purpose.\nI match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.\n1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset Deep work in short bursts – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching. Digital decluttering – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling. Brain dump journaling – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space. 2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue Fewer choices – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to. Emotional boundaries – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions. Journaling – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up. 3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration Consume good input – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things. Change of scenery – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective. Play – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids. 4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude Meaningful connections only – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk. Scheduled alone time – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions. Boundaries – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel. 5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise Digital detox – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode. Minimalist workspace – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload. Silence and darkness – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses. The Takeaway We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about not sleeping enough.\nBut the real question isn’t \u0026ldquo;Am I tired?\u0026rdquo;—it’s \u0026ldquo;What kind of tired am I?\u0026rdquo;\nOnce you figure that out?\nYou can finally start recharging the right way.\nAnd you might just find that you’re not broken.\nYou were just resting wrong.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-youre-always-tired-not-just-about-sleep/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I thought I was just \u003cem\u003etired.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time.

It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reshape them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not that things were better. It’s that we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo\u0026hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that in my life today. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.\nSo next time you find yourself saying, “Things were better back then”, stop and ask:\nOr maybe\u0026hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?\nMaybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how distracted, rushed, and stressed we’ve become.\nMaybe the best days aren’t behind us.\nMaybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver caught yourself thinking, \u003cem\u003e“Things were better back then”\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just \u003cem\u003efelt\u003c/em\u003e different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do this all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\nI remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being \u003cem\u003edisconnected.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)"},{"content":"I don’t know why, but finding the right backpack feels like a life quest—like I’m a video game character on an endless side mission.\nI’ve owned plenty of backpacks.

No organization, just one giant pocket where everything disappears.\nWant your keys? Hope you enjoy an archaeological dig.\nIt’s always the same scenario:\nI’m in a rush.

And when it breaks, it does so with the dramatic flair of a telenovela character. I also break things on purpose—because the best way to fix something is to first see how it falls apart.\nBy day, I’m a PHP backend engineer, making sure systems don’t implode (or at least fail gracefully). I work remotely from Brooklyn 🗽, where my bugs come with complimentary fixes—or at least a very convincing explanation.\nBy night, I trade in debugging for Dad Logic™ (which, let’s be honest, never works 🤷‍♂️) and a never-ending quest to impress my wife with the tech gadgets she never asked for.\n🌍 A Life Between Two Worlds Born in New York, raised in Italy, and now back in the city that never sleeps, my life has been a series of loops—like a recursive function that just won’t quit.\nI didn’t follow a straight path. After spending nearly a decade wrestling with a computer science degree that refused to cooperate, I built my own way forward. Instead of perfect grades, I gained a problem-solving mindset that helps me tackle challenges from unexpected angles.\nAnd while my Italian roots run deep (especially when it comes to good food 🍝), my New York grit means I refuse to settle for anything less than perfection.\n💻 What I Do I love building, fixing, and optimizing—whether it’s backend systems, workflows, or my workspace setup that I will never stop tweaking.\nMy work revolves around:\n✔ PHP Development – Making things work behind the scenes.\n✔ Problem-Solving – Debugging what others avoid.\n✔ System Optimization – Streamlining, automating, improving.\nBut beyond coding, I’m always learning, exploring, and experimenting—from digital minimalism (a great excuse to buy better gadgets) to productivity hacks (that I sometimes ignore).\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Life Outside Code When I’m not deep in terminal commands, I’m:\nBeing a dad – Raising two amazing kids: one who questions everything 🤔, and one who ensures I never sleep.

I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.\nAnd slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:\nThis tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.\nHe Tasted the World — Literally Babies have 30,000 taste buds. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s three times more than adults.\nWhen my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if you could taste shapes, or feel sounds.\nSome researchers believe that babies might experience synesthesia early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally taste textures or feel sounds before those brain connections settle down.\nHonestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.\nHe Saw Things I’ll Never See Again At one point, my son could recognize every human face — no matter the ethnicity. Even monkeys. Yes, monkeys.\nBut then came perceptual narrowing: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, “We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”\nNow he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.\nFor a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.\nAnd we call adults smart?\nHe Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked vision and touch.\nThis is called peripersonal space awareness, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.\nBy eight months, babies expect sensory outcomes — and are surprised when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.\nThat’s if-then logic, built in.\nAnd unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.\nHe Could Hear Every Language on Earth Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones we don’t even speak.\nHindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.\nBut as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.\nThis is called phonetic narrowing. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.\nMeanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.\nHis Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t. There’s this old myth that babies lose the stepping reflex by 2 months. Not true.\nWhat actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.\nIn fact, one study showed that babies who \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the stepping reflex started doing it again… in water, where their legs were lighter.\nSo yes — my son had the walking software pre-installed, he was just waiting for the driver update.\nHe Knows If You\u0026rsquo;re a Good Person Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.\nThey even prefer nice puppets over mean ones. Without being told.\nThat’s proto-moral reasoning. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.\nIf my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.\nHe Does Math. The Impossible Kind. If you show a baby a simple math \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.\nThat’s because they know something’s off.\nIt’s called number sense.\nNo formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.\nIt’s basically unit testing for logic — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.\nBabbling = Precompiled Language When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.\nHe’s compiling syntax.\nStudies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will babble with their hands. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.\nSo language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about brains. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.\nHe’s not learning language. He’s already running the beta release.\nHis Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids Here’s what’s running during nap time:\nNeural pruning REM-driven memory consolidation Cortisol modulation Synaptic reorganization Night mode updates Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.\nIt’s unsupervised machine learning, every night.\nWhich is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.\nFinal Thoughts Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.\nBut none of it — none of it — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.\nHe’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.\nHe’s not just smart.\nHe’s smarter than ChatGPT.\nAnd when I ask him something…\nHe looks me in the eye…\n…and says: \u0026ldquo;Banana.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt\"\u003eMy Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was smart.

No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a Content Management System (CMS) feels like.\nI should know. I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.\nFor me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.\nSo, What Exactly Is a CMS? Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically the control center of a website. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content without touching a single line of code.\nThink of it like a kitchen. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.\nWithout a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. It’s not pretty.\nWhy Should You Care? Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).\nA painfully slow website (the kind that makes you question all your life choices). Articles impossible to find (why is the latest election update buried under \u0026ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil\u0026rdquo;?). A paywall that feels like a trap (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand). A good CMS, though? It keeps everything fast, smooth, and user-friendly. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists actually get paid.\nAnd that’s exactly what we do at BLOX Digital.\nWhy BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT) At BLOX Digital, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build the CMS platform.\nPowering 2,000+ news sites across the U.S. Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year Helping media companies stay profitable while keeping journalism accessible How? BLOX CMS – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes. BLOX Audience+ – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense. BLOX YieldUp – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess. But the thing I’m really excited about?\nBLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.\nReal-time collaboration – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism. AI-powered tools – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content. One-click publishing to multiple platforms – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place. A modern, intuitive interface – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.\nEarly partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.\nThe Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People. You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.\nGuy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:\n“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”\nBasically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.\nThey see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because \u0026ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.\nThe Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.\nThat’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.\nMy work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.\nNewsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.\nThat’s why BLOX NXT matters. And that’s why I can’t stop talking about it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cms-digital-publishing-blox-nxt/","summary":"A CMS isn\u0026rsquo;t just a tool—it\u0026rsquo;s the backbone of digital publishing.

And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.\nWell, let me tell you—it is. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.\nLet’s get into it.\n1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.\nJPG compresses images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little\u0026hellip; off.\nPNG, on the other hand, keeps everything. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.\nSo, if you care about keeping things crisp, PNG is your best friend.\n2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It. Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do transparency.\nPNG? Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.\nThis is huge if you’re working with logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.\nOr, you know, just use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache.\n3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into blurry, blocky nonsense. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.\nIf you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, stick with PNG. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.\nAnd no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t completely fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.\n4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression at work.\nPNG keeps all the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”\nIf you’re working on art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you like your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.\n5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality gets worse.\nPNG? Doesn’t budge.\nThis is huge if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.\nAlso, if you’re archiving old photos, PNG is the way to go. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, “Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”\nBut Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better? Look, JPG isn’t evil. It’s just… situational.\nIf you’re dealing with big photos and need to save space, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that don’t need to be perfect.\nBut if you’re working with logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine, PNG is the move.\nFinal Thoughts So next time you’re about to hit \u0026ldquo;Save As,\u0026rdquo; ask yourself: Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later? If the answer to any of those is yes, PNG all the way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: \u003cstrong\u003ePNG or JPG?\u003c/strong\u003e And suddenly, you pause.

Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.\nBut Italian-style bread? That was a different story.\nToo Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless? The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:\n1️⃣ Too soft—like, pillow soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.\n2️⃣ Too sweet—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.\n3️⃣ Too tasteless—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite\u0026hellip; nothing. Just air and disappointment.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the prices.\nArtisan bakeries? Amazing.\nBut unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.\nA Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer) Enter: My Wife, The Genius.\nLast Christmas, B (my wife) surprised me with a bread machine.\nHonestly? I wasn’t expecting it.\nI’d casually (let’s say \u0026ldquo;casually\u0026rdquo;) complained:\nHow expensive good bread was. How nothing tasted quite right. How I wished I could just make my own. Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom!

Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency.\n(Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.)\nTurns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.\nBread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba) In Italy, we don’t have a special “bread flour” on supermarket shelves.\nInstead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure.\nSimple, right?\nWell, try finding Manitoba flour in New York.\nI dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.\nEventually, I cracked the code:\n✔ Just buy bread flour. Problem solved.\nBut then I had another discovery—one that changed everything:\nSemolina: The Secret Weapon The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing.\n✔ The crust had that snap.\n✔ The inside had more flavor.\n✔ The whole loaf just felt… right.\nNot easy to find, but totally worth the effort.\nAnd that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements.\nI love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better.\nMaybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows? Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda. Let’s talk cost.\nMaking bread at home isn’t free.\nGood flour isn’t cheap.\nAnd yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).\nBut\u0026hellip;\n✔ Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? Nope.\n✔ Is it way better than supermarket bread? Absolutely.\n✔ Does it take more than four minutes of effort?

No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.\nAt first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… until it didn’t.\nJekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:\nSlow build times – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee. Ruby dependencies – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon. Outdated themes – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012. I tried alternatives:\nGhost – Overkill for a simple blog. WordPress – Too bloated. Eleventy – Cool, but required too much setup. Pelican – Python-based, but didn’t click with me. Then I found Hugo—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.\nWhy I Stuck with GitHub Pages I kept everything on GitHub Pages because:\nIt’s free – No hosting costs. Free is always good. Automatic updates – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly. Easy domain linking – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle. No maintenance – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish. Version control built-in – I can roll back changes if I break something (which happens often). With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup) Unlike Jekyll, which requires bundle install and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.\nOn macOS:\nbrew install hugo\nOn Windows: Download it from Hugo’s GitHub releases and add it to your PATH.\nOn Linux:\nsudo apt install hugo\nTo verify the installation:\nhugo version\rThat’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.\nStep 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…) At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s content/posts/ folder, and everything would work.\nIt didn’t.\nWhat Broke? Folder structure – Jekyll stores posts in _posts/, but Hugo expects them in content/posts/. Front matter differences – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON. Permalinks – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently. To move the posts:\nmkdir -p content/posts\rmv _posts/* content/posts/\rThen, I had to clean up the front matter:\nfind content/posts -type f -name \u0026quot;*.\rmd\u0026quot; -exec sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \\;\rThat was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… until it isn’t.\nStep 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making) I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:\nMainroad – Clean, but too plain. Anubis – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted. Hello-Friend – Nice, but missing features I needed. PaperMod – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak. Installing PaperMod was simple:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod\rThen, I updated config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot;\rFor now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.\nStep 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken) I ran:\nhugo server -D\r…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.\nWhat Went Wrong? Jekyll’s /assets/ folder didn’t move – I had to copy it manually. Relative links broke – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll. Markdown formatting was stricter – Sloppy formatting? Not happening. After fixing those, my site finally worked.\nStep 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…) Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.\nRun Hugo’s build command\nhugo\rThis generates a public/ folder with the static files.\nPush to GitHub\ncd public\rgit initgit add .git commit -m \u0026quot;Deploy Hugo site\u0026quot;\rgit push origin main\rAt first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up GitHub Actions to automate everything.\nStep 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone) Enable Dark Mode [params] defaultTheme = \u0026quot;dark\u0026quot;\rEnable Search [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]\rCustomize Sidebar Profile [params.profileMode] enabled = true title = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;images/profile.jpg\u0026quot;\rEvery time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.\nWas It Worth It? Hugo is fast – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait. No more Ruby dependencies – No bundle exec, no errors, no wasted time. PaperMod works out of the box – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization. What I’d Do Differently Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually. Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once. Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down. Why I’ll Keep Blogging This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.\nA personal blog is like a journal – It helps me organize my thoughts. It’s my escape from social media – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen. It’s mine, forever – No company can shadowban or de-platform me. I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.\nWhat I do know is this:\nI like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet.

But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a blank canvas, and I decide the rules. The free version is actually good. Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using a relic from 2010. I can publish and share pages instantly. No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done. I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost. Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—they all have a home now. And somehow, I can actually find them when I need them. Before Notion, my workflow was a mess.\nNotes buried in random text files. Ideas scattered in Google Keep, which I’d forget existed.

Yeah, I know—Notion doesn’t work offline.\nFor most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? It doesn’t matter.\nI work online all the time. My job as a developer is remote.

You type something completely ridiculous, like:\n\u0026ldquo;PHP array error help please what is happening\u0026rdquo;\nYou find a Stack Overflow thread from 2012. Someone had a similar problem. The top answer is:\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried restarting your computer?\u0026rdquo;\nYou scroll down. Another answer looks promising. You copy and paste the code without reading it.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nStep 4: The Deep Spiral (\u0026ldquo;I have made a terrible mistake.\u0026rdquo;) You start adding random print statements.\nYou go deeper into Stack Overflow.

It worked.\nI was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.\nBut then something strange happened.\nDespite all my so-called productivity, I felt like I was going nowhere.\n❌ Busy, but not fulfilled.\n❌ Efficient, but not effective.\n❌ Always working, but never actually moving forward.\nAnd that’s when I realized: The way we think about productivity is broken.\nThe False Promise of “Getting More Done” Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a lie:\n🛑 That the key to success is efficiency.\n🛑 That if we just optimize our time perfectly, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.\nBut here’s the truth:\nProductivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the right things done. And if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\n1️⃣ You feel overwhelmed. Too much to do, not enough time.\n2️⃣ You try to optimize. Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.\n3️⃣ You get efficient\u0026hellip; at the wrong things. Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually matters.\n4️⃣ You stay stuck in a loop of busyness. Always “doing,” never really progressing.\nThis is the scary part:\nProductivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion. And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.\nI was checking boxes but not moving forward.\nI was working hard but not working smart.\nI was busy—but not productive.\nThe Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition I used to ask myself:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, I ask a better question:\n\u0026ldquo;What can I remove?\u0026rdquo;\nReal productivity isn’t about adding more tasks.\nIt’s about:\n✔ Eliminating distractions.\n✔ Cutting useless work.\n✔ Focusing on what actually moves the needle.\nHere’s how I flipped my mindset:\n1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.\nIt felt productive, but in reality? It was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort.\nBut most of us spend time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nI ask:\n✔ What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?\n✔ What can I cut without any real consequence?\nThen, I ruthlessly focus on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking.\nBut multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time.\nNow, I do the opposite:\n✔ One tab at a time. No distractions.\n✔ One task at a time. Full focus, deep work.\n✔ One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth.\nIt feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort.\nThey spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\n✔ Do fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.\n✔ Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.\n✔ Focus on quality over quantity.\nIronically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\n✔ How much progress I make on things that actually matter.\n✔ How much energy I have left at the end of the day.\n✔ How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.\nI stopped asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd started asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do less, but better?\u0026rdquo;\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\n✔ Instead of doing more, do less—strategically.\n✔ Instead of working harder, work on the right things.\n✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity.\nBecause the most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done.\nThey’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret.\nIt’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity-trap-why-doing-more-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductivity was about doing more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✔ More tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More efficiency.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More checkboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn’t constantly \u003cstrong\u003eoptimizing, planning, and squeezing every second\u003c/strong\u003e for maximum output, I was failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at first? \u003cstrong\u003eIt worked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting things done.

I’d see guys with thick, full beards and think, Yeah, that’s just not for me.\nIt wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:\n✔ I shave because I always have.\n✔ I’m just not a beard person.\nAnd then, one day\u0026hellip; I didn’t shave.\nThe Accidental Beard Experiment I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, I shall grow a beard!\nIt started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had more stubble than usual.\nNormally, this would have annoyed me. But this time?\nI let it stay.\nAt first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me. I\u0026rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, Who is this guy?\nThe itchy phase was real.\nThe awkward patchy phase was even more real.\nBut the strangest part?\nI kind of liked it.\nI started noticing little things:\nIt made me look older (or maybe just different). It changed the shape of my face. I kept catching myself stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher. And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a reminder that something was changing.\nWhy Growing a Beard Felt So… Different It’s funny how something as simple as not shaving can change the way you see yourself.\nI looked different. My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a real-life Instagram filter. I felt different. There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more deliberate. Like I had made a choice, even if that choice was just to\u0026hellip; not shave. Other people noticed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You look… more Italian now.\u0026rdquo; (That one made me laugh.) I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, when all I did was\u0026hellip; nothing.\nAnd every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.\nWhat I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing Growing a beard didn’t change my life.\nBut it did make me realize something important.\nSo many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults”—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.\nFor years, I thought:\n✔ I’m a clean-shaven guy.\n✔ Beards don’t suit me.\n✔ This is just how I look.\nAnd then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.\nIt made me wonder:\nHow many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?\nI’m not a morning person. (Or am I just used to staying up late?) I don’t like public speaking. (Or have I just never given it a real chance?) I’m not a beard guy. (Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?) It’s strange how something as simple as not shaving can make you question so much more.\nWill I Keep It? I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll shave it off next week.\nMaybe I’ll keep it longer.\nRight now, I’m just letting it be.\nNo expectations. No rules.

Everything I do is digital.\nAnd yet, whenever I need to truly think, whenever I need to solve a problem, I reach for something ancient.\nPaper.\nYes, real, dead-tree, old-school paper. With an actual pen. No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.\nWhy Do I Do This? People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?\u0026rdquo;\nI tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.\nBut every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.\nWith paper, I can:\nThink freely without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications. Draw connections with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate. Physically slow down, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving. I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because it works.\nThe Problem with Digital Thinking I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:\nThey make everything too neat.\nTyping forces you into a linear thought process. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.\nBut real problem-solving? It’s messy.\nIt’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.\nDigital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.\nWhen I write on paper, I’m not editing as I think. I’m letting ideas collide, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.\nPaper is My Debugging Tool For some people, thinking happens on the keyboard.\nFor me, thinking happens with a pen.\nIt’s not just about notes—it’s about clarity. It’s about processing. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.\nBefore I write code, I write on paper. I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture. Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out. I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster. Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page. I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios. By the time I finally touch the keyboard, I already know what I’m doing.\nThe Takeaway People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job isn’t the newest or the most advanced—it’s just the one that works.\nNo productivity hack replaces thinking.\nNo app mimics messy creativity.\nNo digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.\nSo yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.\nBut also? Watch me solve problems faster than you.\nBecause in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues.

Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.\n🔹 Not as objects, but as decisions.\nI don’t want five backpacks—I want one that does it all.\nI don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want one that feels perfect in my hand.\nI don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.\nThis isn’t just minimalism.\nIt’s ruthless optimization.\nThe Rules of the Game Finding The One is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.\n1️⃣ Compactness is king. If it’s too bulky, it’s out.

There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.\nBut the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.\nIt’s about curating my life to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about choosing quality over quantity in every decision.\nSo if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.\nAnd when I finally find The One?\n✔ I’ll stop looking.\n✔ Until the next perfect version comes out. 😉\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pursuit-of-perfect-quest-for-ultimate-everything/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003cstrong\u003ecollect things\u003c/strong\u003e.

No clear story, no control, and just when things start to make sense—BAM! A sudden cut to something completely different.\nOne moment, I’m focused, working hard. The next?\nOh wow, did you know ancient Romans made concrete that still exists today?\nWait, wasn’t I supposed to answer an email?\nOh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let me check\u0026hellip;\nWait. What was I doing?\nAnd just like that, 30 minutes disappear. I’m holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of a completely different task than the one I started.\nThe Productivity Toolbox: Everything I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work) I’ve tested every productivity method I could find.\nPost-it Notes? Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board. Timers? Useful—if I remember I set them. To-do lists? I write them, I admire them\u0026hellip; I never check them again. Productivity apps? I collect them like Pokémon. I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? None work if I forget to open them. Pomodoro? Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists. I’ve heard all the usual advice:\n\u0026ldquo;Just choose your priorities!\u0026rdquo; But everything feels important.\n\u0026ldquo;Use reminders!\u0026rdquo; Great idea—if I remember to set them.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?\u0026rdquo; Yes. I lost track of them too.\nIt’s not that I don’t try. I do. But my brain doesn’t follow the rules.\nAnd yet… I still get things done.\nHow I Actually Get Work Done I stopped looking for one perfect system—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of simple tricks and mental hacks to keep myself productive.\nOne task at a time. Multitasking? I quit that. If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing nothing. Writing everything down. My memory is unreliable, so I put everything in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it. The Two-Minute Rule. If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned. But the most important thing?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to use systems made for other people. I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.

I build things for the web. I write code.\nI understand how browsers work.\nAnd yet, somehow, choosing a default browser nearly broke me.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. It’s just a browser.\nA glorified tab holder. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. Freedom.\nOr so I thought.\nIn reality, every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.\nChrome – The original Chromium overlord. Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months? Also yes.\nBecause let’s be real—the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/browser-wars-journey-to-least-annoying-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m a software developer.

Push through resistance. Be disciplined.\nI told myself, “Just do it. No excuses.”\nAnd for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.\nBut then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.\nAnd every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.\nThen I learned something that changed everything:\nWe don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Trying Harder\u0026rdquo; Never Works Think about this:\nTwo people are offered a cigarette.\nThe first person says, “No thanks, I’m trying to quit.” The second person says, “No thanks, I don’t smoke.” The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.\nThe first person is using willpower—constantly resisting. The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted. That’s why most habits fail.\nWe focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.\nThe Identity-Based Approach to Change Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.\nEvery action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.\nIf I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer. If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges. I had to stop seeing habits as things I do and start seeing them as things that define who I am.\nHow I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change I started with small identity shifts:\nInstead of “I should exercise more,” I tell myself “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.” Instead of “I need to focus better,” I remind myself “I’m someone who works with deep focus.” Instead of “I need to stop procrastinating,” I say “I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.” At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:\nThe brain hates cognitive dissonance.\nWhen you tell yourself you are something, you subconsciously start acting like it.\nIf I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day. If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes. If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character. It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.\nThe Difference Between Trying and Being I used to say:\n“I’m trying to exercise more.” “I’m trying to focus better.” “I’m trying to wake up earlier.” Now I say:\n“I’m a person who moves every day.” “I’m someone who works with focus.” “I’m the kind of person who gets up early.” The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.\nAnd identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.\nThe Takeaway Willpower is unreliable.\nMotivation fades.\nBut identity sticks.\nIf you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.\nStart with who you are.\nWant to read more? Become a reader. Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health. Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it. Because the truth is:\nWe don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.\nChange who you are, and the actions will follow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-struggle-to-change-simple-fix-that-works/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think change was about willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder.

Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/motivation-myth-why-waiting-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I waited for \u003cstrong\u003emotivation to strike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductive people\u003c/strong\u003e had some kind of \u003cstrong\u003emagical drive\u003c/strong\u003e I didn’t.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat one day, I’d wake up \u003cstrong\u003efull of energy\u003c/strong\u003e, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects \u003cstrong\u003ewithout procrastinating\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day \u003cstrong\u003enever came.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it never \u003cem\u003ewill.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here’s the truth:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck"},{"content":"Some people think changing your mind is a weakness—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That certainty equals strength and doubt makes you unreliable.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. Not because I’m indecisive, but because I’m learning.\nThe Art of Arguing With Yourself It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly\u0026hellip; doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us \u0026ldquo;won.\u0026rdquo;\nNot because we’re trying to be \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being \u0026ldquo;consistent.\u0026rdquo; But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds?

Classic exhaustion, right?\nSo I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.\nBut no matter what I did, the fatigue never went away.\nI blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, \u0026ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I realized something.\nI wasn’t just physically exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.\nAnd no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.\nBecause we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.\nThe 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them) 1. Mental Exhaustion (The Overloaded Brain) Too many tabs open (in your browser and your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.\nSymptoms: Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination. 2. Emotional Exhaustion (The Feeling Drain) When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.\nSymptoms: Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap. 3. Creative Exhaustion (The Empty Tank) The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in \u0026lsquo;output mode\u0026rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.\nSymptoms: Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking. 4. Social Exhaustion (The People Drain) It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.\nSymptoms: Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings. 5. Sensory Exhaustion (The Overstimulation Overload) Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.\nSymptoms: Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness. Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest) Here’s the problem: we treat them all the same way.\nMental exhaustion? We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive. Emotional exhaustion? We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them. Creative exhaustion? We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it. Social exhaustion? We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue. Sensory exhaustion? We \u0026ldquo;relax\u0026rdquo; by staring at another screen. We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.\nBut if you don’t know what kind of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.\nSo Here’s How I’m Fixing It Instead of \u0026ldquo;resting\u0026rdquo; in a generic way, I’m resting with purpose.\nI match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.\n1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset Deep work in short bursts – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching. Digital decluttering – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling. Brain dump journaling – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space. 2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue Fewer choices – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to. Emotional boundaries – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions. Journaling – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up. 3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration Consume good input – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things. Change of scenery – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective. Play – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids. 4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude Meaningful connections only – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk. Scheduled alone time – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions. Boundaries – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel. 5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise Digital detox – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode. Minimalist workspace – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload. Silence and darkness – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses. The Takeaway We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about not sleeping enough.\nBut the real question isn’t \u0026ldquo;Am I tired?\u0026rdquo;—it’s \u0026ldquo;What kind of tired am I?\u0026rdquo;\nOnce you figure that out?\nYou can finally start recharging the right way.\nAnd you might just find that you’re not broken.\nYou were just resting wrong.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-youre-always-tired-not-just-about-sleep/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I thought I was just \u003cem\u003etired.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time.

It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reshape them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not that things were better. It’s that we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo\u0026hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that in my life today. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.\nSo next time you find yourself saying, “Things were better back then”, stop and ask:\nOr maybe\u0026hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?\nMaybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how distracted, rushed, and stressed we’ve become.\nMaybe the best days aren’t behind us.\nMaybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver caught yourself thinking, \u003cem\u003e“Things were better back then”\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just \u003cem\u003efelt\u003c/em\u003e different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do this all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\nI remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being \u003cem\u003edisconnected.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)"},{"content":"I don’t know why, but finding the right backpack feels like a life quest—like I’m a video game character on an endless side mission.\nI’ve owned plenty of backpacks.

The “Looks Perfect But Feels Terrible” Backpack I’ve been betrayed by backpacks that seem like the one, only to realize:\nThe straps dig into my shoulders like tiny instruments of torture. The padding looks comfortable, but after an hour of walking, my shoulders are on fire. Even the most \u0026ldquo;ergonomic\u0026rdquo; designs somehow turn into medieval punishment devices when I’m rushing through NYC. 2. The “Endless Black Hole” Backpack You know the kind. No organization, just one giant pocket where everything disappears.\nWant your keys? Hope you enjoy an archaeological dig.\nIt’s always the same scenario:\nI’m in a rush. The thing I need is somewhere at the bottom. I dig through tangled charging cables, crumpled receipts, and a water bottle that somehow went horizontal. By the time I find my keys, I’m questioning every decision that led me to this moment. 3. The “Too Many Compartments” Backpack At first, it seems genius. A special pocket for everything!\nThen, a month later, I can’t remember where anything is.\nIt’s a scavenger hunt every time I need my headphones.\nThere’s a pocket for my phone, a secret compartment for my wallet, a tiny slot for pens, and another one\u0026hellip; for\u0026hellip; what was that even for?\nThe more organized it tries to be, the more chaotic my life becomes.\n4. The “Why Is This So Heavy?!” Backpack Empty, it already feels like I’m carrying bricks.\nAdd a laptop and a water bottle, and suddenly I need physical therapy.\nI try to be a minimalist, but the backpack itself sabotages me.\nNow I check product descriptions for the empty weight before even considering a purchase.\nIf it feels heavy in the store, it’s already dead to me.\nWhy Do I Even Care This Much? I know this sounds ridiculous.\n\u0026ldquo;It’s just a backpack, right?\u0026rdquo;\nBut here’s the thing:\nA backpack is a daily companion.\nIt’s with you through:\nLong walks. Commutes.

One jacket. One bag.\n✔ No backups. No alternatives.

I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.\nAnd slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:\nThis tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.\nHe Tasted the World — Literally Babies have 30,000 taste buds. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s three times more than adults.\nWhen my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if you could taste shapes, or feel sounds.\nSome researchers believe that babies might experience synesthesia early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally taste textures or feel sounds before those brain connections settle down.\nHonestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.\nHe Saw Things I’ll Never See Again At one point, my son could recognize every human face — no matter the ethnicity. Even monkeys. Yes, monkeys.\nBut then came perceptual narrowing: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, “We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”\nNow he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.\nFor a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.\nAnd we call adults smart?\nHe Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked vision and touch.\nThis is called peripersonal space awareness, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.\nBy eight months, babies expect sensory outcomes — and are surprised when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.\nThat’s if-then logic, built in.\nAnd unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.\nHe Could Hear Every Language on Earth Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones we don’t even speak.\nHindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.\nBut as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.\nThis is called phonetic narrowing. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.\nMeanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.\nHis Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t. There’s this old myth that babies lose the stepping reflex by 2 months. Not true.\nWhat actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.\nIn fact, one study showed that babies who \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the stepping reflex started doing it again… in water, where their legs were lighter.\nSo yes — my son had the walking software pre-installed, he was just waiting for the driver update.\nHe Knows If You\u0026rsquo;re a Good Person Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.\nThey even prefer nice puppets over mean ones. Without being told.\nThat’s proto-moral reasoning. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.\nIf my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.\nHe Does Math. The Impossible Kind. If you show a baby a simple math \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.\nThat’s because they know something’s off.\nIt’s called number sense.\nNo formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.\nIt’s basically unit testing for logic — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.\nBabbling = Precompiled Language When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.\nHe’s compiling syntax.\nStudies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will babble with their hands. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.\nSo language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about brains. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.\nHe’s not learning language. He’s already running the beta release.\nHis Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids Here’s what’s running during nap time:\nNeural pruning REM-driven memory consolidation Cortisol modulation Synaptic reorganization Night mode updates Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.\nIt’s unsupervised machine learning, every night.\nWhich is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.\nFinal Thoughts Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.\nBut none of it — none of it — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.\nHe’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.\nHe’s not just smart.\nHe’s smarter than ChatGPT.\nAnd when I ask him something…\nHe looks me in the eye…\n…and says: \u0026ldquo;Banana.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt\"\u003eMy Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was smart.

No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a Content Management System (CMS) feels like.\nI should know. I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.\nFor me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.\nSo, What Exactly Is a CMS? Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically the control center of a website. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content without touching a single line of code.\nThink of it like a kitchen. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.\nWithout a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. It’s not pretty.\nWhy Should You Care? Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).\nA painfully slow website (the kind that makes you question all your life choices). Articles impossible to find (why is the latest election update buried under \u0026ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil\u0026rdquo;?). A paywall that feels like a trap (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand). A good CMS, though? It keeps everything fast, smooth, and user-friendly. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists actually get paid.\nAnd that’s exactly what we do at BLOX Digital.\nWhy BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT) At BLOX Digital, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build the CMS platform.\nPowering 2,000+ news sites across the U.S. Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year Helping media companies stay profitable while keeping journalism accessible How? BLOX CMS – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes. BLOX Audience+ – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense. BLOX YieldUp – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess. But the thing I’m really excited about?\nBLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.\nReal-time collaboration – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism. AI-powered tools – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content. One-click publishing to multiple platforms – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place. A modern, intuitive interface – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.\nEarly partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.\nThe Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People. You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.\nGuy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:\n“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”\nBasically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.\nThey see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because \u0026ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.\nThe Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.\nThat’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.\nMy work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.\nNewsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.\nThat’s why BLOX NXT matters. And that’s why I can’t stop talking about it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cms-digital-publishing-blox-nxt/","summary":"A CMS isn\u0026rsquo;t just a tool—it\u0026rsquo;s the backbone of digital publishing.

And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.\nWell, let me tell you—it is. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.\nLet’s get into it.\n1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.\nJPG compresses images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little\u0026hellip; off.\nPNG, on the other hand, keeps everything. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.\nSo, if you care about keeping things crisp, PNG is your best friend.\n2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It. Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do transparency.\nPNG? Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.\nThis is huge if you’re working with logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.\nOr, you know, just use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache.\n3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into blurry, blocky nonsense. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.\nIf you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, stick with PNG. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.\nAnd no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t completely fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.\n4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression at work.\nPNG keeps all the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”\nIf you’re working on art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you like your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.\n5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality gets worse.\nPNG? Doesn’t budge.\nThis is huge if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.\nAlso, if you’re archiving old photos, PNG is the way to go. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, “Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”\nBut Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better? Look, JPG isn’t evil. It’s just… situational.\nIf you’re dealing with big photos and need to save space, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that don’t need to be perfect.\nBut if you’re working with logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine, PNG is the move.\nFinal Thoughts So next time you’re about to hit \u0026ldquo;Save As,\u0026rdquo; ask yourself: Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later? If the answer to any of those is yes, PNG all the way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: \u003cstrong\u003ePNG or JPG?\u003c/strong\u003e And suddenly, you pause.

This is the one?\nBecause for the longest time, I didn’t.\nMoving to New York, I figured finding good bread would be easy.\nI mean, it’s NYC! Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.\nBut Italian-style bread? That was a different story.\nToo Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless? The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:\n1️⃣ Too soft—like, pillow soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.\n2️⃣ Too sweet—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.\n3️⃣ Too tasteless—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite\u0026hellip; nothing. Just air and disappointment.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the prices.\nArtisan bakeries? Amazing.\nBut unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.\nA Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer) Enter: My Wife, The Genius.\nLast Christmas, B (my wife) surprised me with a bread machine.\nHonestly? I wasn’t expecting it.\nI’d casually (let’s say \u0026ldquo;casually\u0026rdquo;) complained:\nHow expensive good bread was. How nothing tasted quite right. How I wished I could just make my own. Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom! Bread machine under the tree.\n(I love you, B ❤️)\nNow, I’d love to say my first loaf came out perfect.\nThat I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created a masterpiece.\nBut let’s be real—it was a disaster.\nDense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency.\n(Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.)\nTurns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.\nBread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba) In Italy, we don’t have a special “bread flour” on supermarket shelves.\nInstead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure.\nSimple, right?\nWell, try finding Manitoba flour in New York.\nI dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.\nEventually, I cracked the code:\n✔ Just buy bread flour. Problem solved.\nBut then I had another discovery—one that changed everything:\nSemolina: The Secret Weapon The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing.\n✔ The crust had that snap.\n✔ The inside had more flavor.\n✔ The whole loaf just felt… right.\nNot easy to find, but totally worth the effort.\nAnd that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements.\nI love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better.\nMaybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows? Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda. Let’s talk cost.\nMaking bread at home isn’t free.\nGood flour isn’t cheap.\nAnd yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).\nBut\u0026hellip;\n✔ Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? Nope.\n✔ Is it way better than supermarket bread? Absolutely.\n✔ Does it take more than four minutes of effort? Not really.\nFour minutes to throw ingredients in, press a button, and then just wait.\nThat’s it.\n✔ No kneading.\n✔ No babysitting dough.\n✔ Just a little patience.\nAnd the best part? My house smells like a bakery every time.\nThe Never-Ending Bread Journey So here I am, an Italian guy in NYC, still tweaking, learning, experimenting—\nBut finally—finally—happy with my bread.\nAnd if I ever move again (hey, it’s happened before), at least I know one thing:\nGood bread isn’t something you find.

No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.\nAt first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… until it didn’t.\nJekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:\nSlow build times – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee. Ruby dependencies – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon. Outdated themes – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012. I tried alternatives:\nGhost – Overkill for a simple blog. WordPress – Too bloated. Eleventy – Cool, but required too much setup. Pelican – Python-based, but didn’t click with me. Then I found Hugo—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.\nWhy I Stuck with GitHub Pages I kept everything on GitHub Pages because:\nIt’s free – No hosting costs. Free is always good. Automatic updates – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly. Easy domain linking – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle. No maintenance – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish. Version control built-in – I can roll back changes if I break something (which happens often). With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup) Unlike Jekyll, which requires bundle install and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.\nOn macOS:\nbrew install hugo\nOn Windows: Download it from Hugo’s GitHub releases and add it to your PATH.\nOn Linux:\nsudo apt install hugo\nTo verify the installation:\nhugo version\rThat’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.\nStep 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…) At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s content/posts/ folder, and everything would work.\nIt didn’t.\nWhat Broke? Folder structure – Jekyll stores posts in _posts/, but Hugo expects them in content/posts/. Front matter differences – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON. Permalinks – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently. To move the posts:\nmkdir -p content/posts\rmv _posts/* content/posts/\rThen, I had to clean up the front matter:\nfind content/posts -type f -name \u0026quot;*.\rmd\u0026quot; -exec sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \\;\rThat was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… until it isn’t.\nStep 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making) I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:\nMainroad – Clean, but too plain. Anubis – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted. Hello-Friend – Nice, but missing features I needed. PaperMod – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak. Installing PaperMod was simple:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod\rThen, I updated config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot;\rFor now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.\nStep 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken) I ran:\nhugo server -D\r…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.\nWhat Went Wrong? Jekyll’s /assets/ folder didn’t move – I had to copy it manually. Relative links broke – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll. Markdown formatting was stricter – Sloppy formatting? Not happening. After fixing those, my site finally worked.\nStep 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…) Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.\nRun Hugo’s build command\nhugo\rThis generates a public/ folder with the static files.\nPush to GitHub\ncd public\rgit initgit add .git commit -m \u0026quot;Deploy Hugo site\u0026quot;\rgit push origin main\rAt first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up GitHub Actions to automate everything.\nStep 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone) Enable Dark Mode [params] defaultTheme = \u0026quot;dark\u0026quot;\rEnable Search [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]\rCustomize Sidebar Profile [params.profileMode] enabled = true title = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;images/profile.jpg\u0026quot;\rEvery time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.\nWas It Worth It? Hugo is fast – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait. No more Ruby dependencies – No bundle exec, no errors, no wasted time. PaperMod works out of the box – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization. What I’d Do Differently Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually. Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once. Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down. Why I’ll Keep Blogging This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.\nA personal blog is like a journal – It helps me organize my thoughts. It’s my escape from social media – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen. It’s mine, forever – No company can shadowban or de-platform me. I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.\nWhat I do know is this:\nI like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet.

No idea.\nMy brain has this incredible ability to cling to completely useless information while ruthlessly discarding the things I actually need.\nI’ve spent years searching for a way to keep my thoughts, projects, and tasks organized. I tried:\n✔ Sticky notes (good luck finding them when I actually need them\u0026hellip; they vanish into another dimension).\n✔ To-do list apps (too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week).\n✔ Google Docs (a black hole where ideas go to die).\n✔ My own memory (don’t even ask).\nNothing worked.\nThen I stumbled upon Notion, and suddenly, my brain had a backup system.\nWhy Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed) I’ve always been skeptical of “all-in-one” productivity tools.\nEvery app promises to be the last one you’ll ever need—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think.\nNotion is the first one that actually adapts to me.\nIt’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once. But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a blank canvas, and I decide the rules. The free version is actually good. Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using a relic from 2010. I can publish and share pages instantly. No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done. I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost. Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—they all have a home now. And somehow, I can actually find them when I need them. Before Notion, my workflow was a mess.\nNotes buried in random text files. Ideas scattered in Google Keep, which I’d forget existed. Tasks floating in my head, patiently waiting to be forgotten. Now? Everything is in one place. Exactly where I expect it to be.\nIt’s like having my own personal knowledge base, and for the first time, I actually trust my system.\nWhat About the Offline Mode? Yeah, I know—Notion doesn’t work offline.\nFor most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? It doesn’t matter.\nI work online all the time. My job as a developer is remote. My files live in the cloud. My meetings are on video calls.\nThe only time I’d need offline notes is if I were stuck in a cabin with no internet—and at that point, I have bigger problems than note-taking.\nLike figuring out how to survive without Stack Overflow.\nFor my actual, daily reality, Notion’s always-online approach isn’t a limitation.\nIt’s just how I already work.\nThe Takeaway I didn’t think I needed Notion.\nI thought I just needed to be more disciplined or find the “right” system to organize my thoughts. I assumed I was just bad at remembering things, and that was that.\nBut now? I can’t imagine functioning without it.\nIf you’ve ever felt like your thoughts are scattered across a dozen places, if you struggle to remember things you actually need, if you’ve tried every productivity tool and nothing stuck—\nNotion might be exactly what your brain has been waiting for.\nAnd unlike my real brain, it actually remembers things.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/notion-external-brain-that-works-for-me/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I’ve been at war with \u003cstrong\u003emy own memory\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m great at solving problems, debugging complex code, and figuring out tricky logic flows.

Digital Decluttering I used to think a million open tabs meant I was working hard.\nNope.\nIt just meant I was distracted.\nNow, I:\n✔ Close unused tabs.\n✔ Write down what I actually need.\n✔ Handle tasks one at a time.\nIf something’s important, it goes on my Notion board.\nIf it’s not? It’s gone.\n3. The “One-Tab Rule” If my brain wants a second tab, it means I need a second task slot later—not now.\nThis was tough as a developer.\nI’m used to juggling:\n✔ Documentation\n✔ Stack Overflow threads\n✔ My IDE\nBut once I stopped, my focus got sharper.\n4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth Instead of half-absorbing five articles, I read one properly—and actually retain something.\n✔ No more fake productivity.\n✔ No more information overload.\nThe result?\n✔ Deeper focus.\n✔ Lower stress.\n✔ Better work.\n✔ Actually being present in my own life.\nThe Takeaway We’ve been sold the lie that multitasking is the key to success.\nBut what if the real key is the opposite?\nImagine a world where we:\n✔ Stop bragging about being busy.\n✔ Start taking pride in how well we do one thing at a time.\nImagine how different life would feel.\nI’m not perfect at it yet.\nI still catch myself falling back into old habits:\n✔ Checking messages while pushing code.\n✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.\nBut now, I notice it.\nI stop.\nI refocus.\nI’m done with the chaos.\nAre you?

It’s about getting the right things done. And if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\n1️⃣ You feel overwhelmed. Too much to do, not enough time.\n2️⃣ You try to optimize. Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.\n3️⃣ You get efficient\u0026hellip; at the wrong things.

Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.\nIt felt productive, but in reality? It was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort.\nBut most of us spend time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nI ask:\n✔ What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?\n✔ What can I cut without any real consequence?\nThen, I ruthlessly focus on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking.\nBut multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time.\nNow, I do the opposite:\n✔ One tab at a time. No distractions.\n✔ One task at a time. Full focus, deep work.\n✔ One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth.\nIt feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort.\nThey spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\n✔ Do fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.\n✔ Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.\n✔ Focus on quality over quantity.\nIronically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\n✔ How much progress I make on things that actually matter.\n✔ How much energy I have left at the end of the day.\n✔ How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.\nI stopped asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd started asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do less, but better?\u0026rdquo;\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\n✔ Instead of doing more, do less—strategically.\n✔ Instead of working harder, work on the right things.\n✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity.\nBecause the most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done.\nThey’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret.\nIt’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity-trap-why-doing-more-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductivity was about doing more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✔ More tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More efficiency.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More checkboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn’t constantly \u003cstrong\u003eoptimizing, planning, and squeezing every second\u003c/strong\u003e for maximum output, I was failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at first? \u003cstrong\u003eIt worked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting things done.

I’d see guys with thick, full beards and think, Yeah, that’s just not for me.\nIt wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:\n✔ I shave because I always have.\n✔ I’m just not a beard person.\nAnd then, one day\u0026hellip; I didn’t shave.\nThe Accidental Beard Experiment I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, I shall grow a beard!\nIt started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had more stubble than usual.\nNormally, this would have annoyed me. But this time?\nI let it stay.\nAt first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me. I\u0026rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, Who is this guy?\nThe itchy phase was real.\nThe awkward patchy phase was even more real.\nBut the strangest part?\nI kind of liked it.\nI started noticing little things:\nIt made me look older (or maybe just different). It changed the shape of my face. I kept catching myself stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher. And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a reminder that something was changing.\nWhy Growing a Beard Felt So… Different It’s funny how something as simple as not shaving can change the way you see yourself.\nI looked different. My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a real-life Instagram filter. I felt different. There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more deliberate. Like I had made a choice, even if that choice was just to\u0026hellip; not shave. Other people noticed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You look… more Italian now.\u0026rdquo; (That one made me laugh.) I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, when all I did was\u0026hellip; nothing.\nAnd every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.\nWhat I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing Growing a beard didn’t change my life.\nBut it did make me realize something important.\nSo many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults”—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.\nFor years, I thought:\n✔ I’m a clean-shaven guy.\n✔ Beards don’t suit me.\n✔ This is just how I look.\nAnd then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.\nIt made me wonder:\nHow many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?\nI’m not a morning person. (Or am I just used to staying up late?) I don’t like public speaking. (Or have I just never given it a real chance?) I’m not a beard guy. (Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?) It’s strange how something as simple as not shaving can make you question so much more.\nWill I Keep It? I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll shave it off next week.\nMaybe I’ll keep it longer.\nRight now, I’m just letting it be.\nNo expectations. No rules. Just curiosity.\nBut either way, this isn’t really about the beard.\nIt’s about realizing that sometimes, the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.\nAnd honestly?

Everything I do is digital.\nAnd yet, whenever I need to truly think, whenever I need to solve a problem, I reach for something ancient.\nPaper.\nYes, real, dead-tree, old-school paper. With an actual pen. No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.\nWhy Do I Do This? People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?\u0026rdquo;\nI tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.\nBut every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.\nWith paper, I can:\nThink freely without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications. Draw connections with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate. Physically slow down, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving. I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because it works.\nThe Problem with Digital Thinking I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:\nThey make everything too neat.\nTyping forces you into a linear thought process. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.\nBut real problem-solving? It’s messy.\nIt’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.\nDigital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.\nWhen I write on paper, I’m not editing as I think. I’m letting ideas collide, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.\nPaper is My Debugging Tool For some people, thinking happens on the keyboard.\nFor me, thinking happens with a pen.\nIt’s not just about notes—it’s about clarity. It’s about processing. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.\nBefore I write code, I write on paper. I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture. Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out. I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster. Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page. I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios. By the time I finally touch the keyboard, I already know what I’m doing.\nThe Takeaway People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job isn’t the newest or the most advanced—it’s just the one that works.\nNo productivity hack replaces thinking.\nNo app mimics messy creativity.\nNo digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.\nSo yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.\nBut also? Watch me solve problems faster than you.\nBecause in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues.

The features are great, but why is there a subscription for this? It’s perfect on iPhone, but the Windows version looks like it was built in 2009 and abandoned. It’s perfect on Windows, but the iPhone version syncs once every full moon. And just like that, the cycle continues.\nWhy Do I Do This to Myself?

Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.\n🔹 Not as objects, but as decisions.\nI don’t want five backpacks—I want one that does it all.\nI don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want one that feels perfect in my hand.\nI don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.\nThis isn’t just minimalism.\nIt’s ruthless optimization.\nThe Rules of the Game Finding The One is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.\n1️⃣ Compactness is king. If it’s too bulky, it’s out. Portability without sacrifice.\n2️⃣ One item, zero regrets. Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. This is my Excalibur.\n3️⃣ Quality over everything. If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. No disposable junk.\n4️⃣ No over-engineered nonsense. If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I don’t want it. Keep it simple, durable, and effective.\nThis isn’t about being cheap. It’s about investing in the best, once—and then never thinking about it again.\nThe Search is Brutal You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.\nFinding the one perfect item in any category means sifting through a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right options.\nThe best backpack? Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats. The best pen? Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream pretentious fountain pen guy. Found it. But wait—should I test one more? The best toothbrush? Yes, even this is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. Why is this so hard? Each decision is a battle. A war between function and obsession.\nAnd the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.\n❌ “This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”\n❌ “This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”\n❌ “This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”\nI fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make spreadsheets with pros and cons.\nYes, I’m that person.\nWhy I Love This Insanity Some people call it overthinking.\nI call it engineering my life for efficiency.\nBecause once I’ve chosen The One, I’m free.\n✅ No more switching.\n✅ No more rebuying.\n✅ No more second-guessing.\nJust one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.\nIt’s about reducing decision fatigue. It’s about knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me. It’s about portability, mobility, and adaptability.\nIt’s also about being prepared.\nI’ve moved across continents multiple times. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the freedom of traveling light and the nightmare of clutter.\nSo when the next big move happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.\n❌ No clutter.\n❌ No baggage.\n✅ Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.\nThe Final Boss Battle of Minimalism I’m not naive.\nI know The One doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.\nBut the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.\nIt’s about curating my life to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about choosing quality over quantity in every decision.\nSo if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.\nAnd when I finally find The One?\n✔ I’ll stop looking.\n✔ Until the next perfect version comes out. 😉\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pursuit-of-perfect-quest-for-ultimate-everything/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003cstrong\u003ecollect things\u003c/strong\u003e.

Maybe I should try a new one. Let me check\u0026hellip;\nWait. What was I doing?\nAnd just like that, 30 minutes disappear. I’m holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of a completely different task than the one I started.\nThe Productivity Toolbox: Everything I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work) I’ve tested every productivity method I could find.\nPost-it Notes? Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board. Timers? Useful—if I remember I set them. To-do lists? I write them, I admire them\u0026hellip; I never check them again. Productivity apps?

If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned.

I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing. Either way, I’ll figure it out.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-i-outsmart-my-brain-to-get-things-done/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy brain works like an \u003cstrong\u003eaction movie with no pause button\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003eNo clear story, no control\u003c/strong\u003e, and just when things start to make sense—BAM! \u003cstrong\u003eA sudden cut to something completely different.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne moment, I’m focused, working hard.

I build things for the web. I write code.\nI understand how browsers work.\nAnd yet, somehow, choosing a default browser nearly broke me.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. It’s just a browser.\nA glorified tab holder. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. Freedom.\nOr so I thought.\nIn reality, every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.\nChrome – The original Chromium overlord. Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months? Also yes.\nBecause let’s be real—the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/browser-wars-journey-to-least-annoying-setup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’m a software developer.

Push through resistance. Be disciplined.\nI told myself, “Just do it. No excuses.”\nAnd for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.\nBut then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.\nAnd every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.\nThen I learned something that changed everything:\nWe don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Trying Harder\u0026rdquo; Never Works Think about this:\nTwo people are offered a cigarette.\nThe first person says, “No thanks, I’m trying to quit.” The second person says, “No thanks, I don’t smoke.” The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.\nThe first person is using willpower—constantly resisting. The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted. That’s why most habits fail.\nWe focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.\nThe Identity-Based Approach to Change Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.\nEvery action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.\nIf I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer. If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges. I had to stop seeing habits as things I do and start seeing them as things that define who I am.\nHow I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change I started with small identity shifts:\nInstead of “I should exercise more,” I tell myself “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.” Instead of “I need to focus better,” I remind myself “I’m someone who works with deep focus.” Instead of “I need to stop procrastinating,” I say “I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.” At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:\nThe brain hates cognitive dissonance.\nWhen you tell yourself you are something, you subconsciously start acting like it.\nIf I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day. If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes. If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character. It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.\nThe Difference Between Trying and Being I used to say:\n“I’m trying to exercise more.” “I’m trying to focus better.” “I’m trying to wake up earlier.” Now I say:\n“I’m a person who moves every day.” “I’m someone who works with focus.” “I’m the kind of person who gets up early.” The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.\nAnd identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.\nThe Takeaway Willpower is unreliable.\nMotivation fades.\nBut identity sticks.\nIf you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.\nStart with who you are.\nWant to read more? Become a reader. Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health. Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it. Because the truth is:\nWe don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.\nChange who you are, and the actions will follow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-struggle-to-change-simple-fix-that-works/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think change was about willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder.

Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/motivation-myth-why-waiting-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I waited for \u003cstrong\u003emotivation to strike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductive people\u003c/strong\u003e had some kind of \u003cstrong\u003emagical drive\u003c/strong\u003e I didn’t.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat one day, I’d wake up \u003cstrong\u003efull of energy\u003c/strong\u003e, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects \u003cstrong\u003ewithout procrastinating\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day \u003cstrong\u003enever came.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it never \u003cem\u003ewill.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here’s the truth:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck"},{"content":"Some people think changing your mind is a weakness—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever.

After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly\u0026hellip; doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us \u0026ldquo;won.\u0026rdquo;\nNot because we’re trying to be \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being \u0026ldquo;consistent.\u0026rdquo; But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re frozen in time.\nPeople who adapt, question, and rethink?

Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about:\nBeing curious enough to question yourself. Being humble enough to admit when you’re wrong. Being smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.

Classic exhaustion, right?\nSo I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.\nBut no matter what I did, the fatigue never went away.\nI blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, \u0026ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I realized something.\nI wasn’t just physically exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.\nAnd no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.\nBecause we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.\nThe 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them) 1. Mental Exhaustion (The Overloaded Brain) Too many tabs open (in your browser and your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.\nSymptoms: Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination. 2. Emotional Exhaustion (The Feeling Drain) When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.\nSymptoms: Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap. 3. Creative Exhaustion (The Empty Tank) The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in \u0026lsquo;output mode\u0026rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.\nSymptoms: Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking. 4. Social Exhaustion (The People Drain) It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.\nSymptoms: Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings. 5. Sensory Exhaustion (The Overstimulation Overload) Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.\nSymptoms: Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness. Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest) Here’s the problem: we treat them all the same way.\nMental exhaustion? We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive. Emotional exhaustion? We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them. Creative exhaustion? We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it. Social exhaustion? We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue. Sensory exhaustion? We \u0026ldquo;relax\u0026rdquo; by staring at another screen. We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.\nBut if you don’t know what kind of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.\nSo Here’s How I’m Fixing It Instead of \u0026ldquo;resting\u0026rdquo; in a generic way, I’m resting with purpose.\nI match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.\n1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset Deep work in short bursts – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching. Digital decluttering – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling. Brain dump journaling – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space. 2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue Fewer choices – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to. Emotional boundaries – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions. Journaling – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up. 3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration Consume good input – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things. Change of scenery – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective. Play – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids. 4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude Meaningful connections only – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk. Scheduled alone time – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions. Boundaries – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel. 5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise Digital detox – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode. Minimalist workspace – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload. Silence and darkness – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses. The Takeaway We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about not sleeping enough.\nBut the real question isn’t \u0026ldquo;Am I tired?\u0026rdquo;—it’s \u0026ldquo;What kind of tired am I?\u0026rdquo;\nOnce you figure that out?\nYou can finally start recharging the right way.\nAnd you might just find that you’re not broken.\nYou were just resting wrong.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-youre-always-tired-not-just-about-sleep/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I thought I was just \u003cem\u003etired.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time.

It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reshape them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not that things were better. It’s that we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo\u0026hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that in my life today. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.\nSo next time you find yourself saying, “Things were better back then”, stop and ask:\nOr maybe\u0026hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?\nMaybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how distracted, rushed, and stressed we’ve become.\nMaybe the best days aren’t behind us.\nMaybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver caught yourself thinking, \u003cem\u003e“Things were better back then”\u003c/em\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just \u003cem\u003efelt\u003c/em\u003e different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do this all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\nI remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being \u003cem\u003edisconnected.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)"},{"content":"I don’t know why, but finding the right backpack feels like a life quest—like I’m a video game character on an endless side mission.\nI’ve owned plenty of backpacks. But none of them have ever been perfect.\nThere’s always something off.\n✔ Too big. Too small.\n✔ Too many pockets. Not enough pockets.\n✔ Feels great when empty. Turns into a brick when full.\nAnd yet, the search continues.\nThe Backpack Goldilocks Zone I know what I want—at least, in theory.\n✔ Compact but spacious – Big enough for a water bottle, light jacket, emergency battery, and some snacks. But not so big that I look like I’m about to hike the Appalachian Trail.\n✔ Lightweight but durable – Because I don’t want to feel like I’m carrying bricks, but I also don’t want it falling apart in six months.\n✔ Minimalist but functional – Clean design. No excessive straps, no giant logos, no 42 different compartments for things I’ll forget I even packed.\nSounds simple, right?\nYou’d think so.\nBut every time I think I’ve found “the one”, it ends up being\u0026hellip; not quite right.\nIt’s either too bulky when half-empty or too tight when fully loaded. It looks perfect online but feels terrible in real life. It’s either an endless black hole or a maze of tiny compartments that make me question my own memory. I’m not asking for a magic bag of holding.\nJust a backpack that actually fits my daily life.\nThe Backpacks That Have Let Me Down I’ve tried them all.\n1. The “Looks Perfect But Feels Terrible” Backpack I’ve been betrayed by backpacks that seem like the one, only to realize:\nThe straps dig into my shoulders like tiny instruments of torture. The padding looks comfortable, but after an hour of walking, my shoulders are on fire. Even the most \u0026ldquo;ergonomic\u0026rdquo; designs somehow turn into medieval punishment devices when I’m rushing through NYC. 2. The “Endless Black Hole” Backpack You know the kind. No organization, just one giant pocket where everything disappears.\nWant your keys? Hope you enjoy an archaeological dig.\nIt’s always the same scenario:\nI’m in a rush. The thing I need is somewhere at the bottom. I dig through tangled charging cables, crumpled receipts, and a water bottle that somehow went horizontal. By the time I find my keys, I’m questioning every decision that led me to this moment. 3. The “Too Many Compartments” Backpack At first, it seems genius. A special pocket for everything!\nThen, a month later, I can’t remember where anything is.\nIt’s a scavenger hunt every time I need my headphones.\nThere’s a pocket for my phone, a secret compartment for my wallet, a tiny slot for pens, and another one\u0026hellip; for\u0026hellip; what was that even for?\nThe more organized it tries to be, the more chaotic my life becomes.\n4. The “Why Is This So Heavy?!” Backpack Empty, it already feels like I’m carrying bricks.\nAdd a laptop and a water bottle, and suddenly I need physical therapy.\nI try to be a minimalist, but the backpack itself sabotages me.\nNow I check product descriptions for the empty weight before even considering a purchase.\nIf it feels heavy in the store, it’s already dead to me.\nWhy Do I Even Care This Much? I know this sounds ridiculous.\n\u0026ldquo;It’s just a backpack, right?\u0026rdquo;\nBut here’s the thing:\nA backpack is a daily companion.\nIt’s with you through:\nLong walks. Commutes. Unexpected errands. Last-minute snack storage emergencies. The right one makes life easier.\nThe wrong one? An endless source of frustration.\nAnd when you live in New York, where you’re constantly moving, your backpack is an extension of yourself.\nI’m walking miles every day.\nI’m squeezing into crowded subway cars.\nI’m weaving through tourist mobs in Times Square.\nI need a backpack that moves with me—not against me.\nI want to forget it’s even there, not curse its existence every time I try to get my MetroCard.\nThe Minimalist’s Dilemma I’m not just looking for a backpack.\nI’m looking for the one.\nThe last backpack I’ll ever need.\nI love minimalism.\nI’m on a mission to find:\n✔ One perfect item for every category in my life.\n✔ One pen. One jacket. One bag.\n✔ No backups. No alternatives. Just the best version of everything I use.\nSo when it comes to a backpack, it’s not just about functionality.\nIt’s about perfection.\nBecause if I find the right one, I’ll never have to think about backpacks again.\nBut that’s the problem, isn’t it?\nI keep thinking about backpacks.\nI keep testing, trying, and switching.\nBecause none of them have been “the one.”\nWill I Ever Find “The One”? I’d love to say I’ve finally found my perfect backpack, but let’s be real—this is an ongoing saga.\nMaybe the backpack is out there, waiting for me to discover it. Maybe it doesn’t exist, and I’ll just cycle through 20 more before giving up. Maybe, like some kind of minimalist curse, I’m doomed to be haunted by this search forever. Or maybe…\nJust maybe…\nThe real perfect backpack was the friends we made along the way.\n(But also, if you have any recommendations, please let me know.

I work in tech. I troubleshoot complex systems. I optimize databases. I write code that doesn’t crash on Fridays. But then I had a son.\nAnd slowly, I began to realize something deeply humbling:\nThis tiny human — who still occasionally tries to eat my slipper — is doing things that would blow the minds of most adults I know. Including, at times, myself.\nHe Tasted the World — Literally Babies have 30,000 taste buds. Not just on the tongue — all over the mouth. That’s three times more than adults.\nWhen my son eats mashed banana, it’s not just a snack. It’s a multi-sensory fireworks display. Imagine if you could taste shapes, or feel sounds.\nSome researchers believe that babies might experience synesthesia early on — a cross-wiring of the senses. That means he may literally taste textures or feel sounds before those brain connections settle down.\nHonestly, it explains a lot. Including the deep betrayal he expressed after tasting broccoli.\nHe Saw Things I’ll Never See Again At one point, my son could recognize every human face — no matter the ethnicity. Even monkeys. Yes, monkeys.\nBut then came perceptual narrowing: the brain’s way of optimizing for the environment. Like a smart algorithm that prunes unused inputs, his brain decided, “We’re not seeing a lot of lemurs around here. Let’s drop that subroutine.”\nNow he’s laser-focused on familiar faces and sounds — namely, the ones he sees and hears at home in Italian and English.\nFor a brief time, though, he had global facial and phonetic superpowers.\nAnd we call adults smart?\nHe Predicted Physics Before Sitting Up At just four months, he understood something was about to touch him before it did. His brain linked vision and touch.\nThis is called peripersonal space awareness, and it means he’s already tracking where his body ends and the world begins. Not bad for someone who still poops in Morse code.\nBy eight months, babies expect sensory outcomes — and are surprised when they don’t happen. That’s physics prediction.\nThat’s if-then logic, built in.\nAnd unlike ChatGPT, he didn’t need a neural net refresh to understand object permanence.\nHe Could Hear Every Language on Earth Until recently, my son could distinguish all the speech sounds in every known language — including ones we don’t even speak.\nHindi? Yup. Zulu clicks? Definitely.\nBut as he tuned into our two native languages — Italian and English — he lost the ability to hear contrasts he no longer needed.\nThis is called phonetic narrowing. It’s like a language engine optimizing for local data.\nMeanwhile, he now says “banana” like it’s a mission-critical API call. Repeated hourly.\nHis Legs Had the Code. His Muscles Didn’t. There’s this old myth that babies lose the stepping reflex by 2 months. Not true.\nWhat actually happens? Their legs get heavier with adorable fat, and the muscles can’t lift them anymore. The code is still running — the hardware just chokes.\nIn fact, one study showed that babies who \u0026ldquo;lost\u0026rdquo; the stepping reflex started doing it again… in water, where their legs were lighter.\nSo yes — my son had the walking software pre-installed, he was just waiting for the driver update.\nHe Knows If You\u0026rsquo;re a Good Person Science shows that babies — around a year old — can distinguish between “helpful” and “mean” behavior.\nThey even prefer nice puppets over mean ones. Without being told.\nThat’s proto-moral reasoning. Meanwhile, I still second-guess whether I was rude in that Slack message 6 hours ago.\nIf my son throws a puff snack at you, just know: it’s not random. It’s social feedback.\nHe Does Math. The Impossible Kind. If you show a baby a simple math \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; — like 1 toy going behind a screen, then another, and when the screen lifts there’s still only 1 toy — they stare longer.\nThat’s because they know something’s off.\nIt’s called number sense.\nNo formulas, no calculator. Just raw violation detection.\nIt’s basically unit testing for logic — except done silently, with judgmental eye contact.\nBabbling = Precompiled Language When he babbles “ba ba ba,” he’s not just making noise.\nHe’s compiling syntax.\nStudies show that even deaf babies exposed to sign language will babble with their hands. Repetitive, rhythmic gestures that look just like spoken babbling.\nSo language prep isn’t about mouths — it’s about brains. And the brain doesn’t care whether you speak with your tongue or your fingers.\nHe’s not learning language. He’s already running the beta release.\nHis Brain Is Basically DevOps on Steroids Here’s what’s running during nap time:\nNeural pruning REM-driven memory consolidation Cortisol modulation Synaptic reorganization Night mode updates Sleep isn’t passive — it’s maintenance.\nIt’s unsupervised machine learning, every night.\nWhich is why I guard nap time like a sysadmin guards uptime.\nFinal Thoughts Every day, I write code. I optimize systems. I fix bugs.\nBut none of it — none of it — compares to what I see unfolding in this curious, gurgling, banana-obsessed small human.\nHe’s learning language with no tutorials. Predicting physics with no math. Judging your character before you say a word.\nHe’s not just smart.\nHe’s smarter than ChatGPT.\nAnd when I ask him something…\nHe looks me in the eye…\n…and says: \u0026ldquo;Banana.\u0026rdquo;\nWhich, honestly, is probably all the wisdom I need.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"my-son-is-smarter-than-chatgpt\"\u003eMy Son Is Smarter Than ChatGPT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was smart.

No knives, no stove, no pots—just your bare hands and sheer determination. Sounds impossible, right? That’s exactly what running a news website without a Content Management System (CMS) feels like.\nI should know. I work as a backend PHP developer at BLOX Digital, where I make sure newsrooms don’t have to suffer through that nightmare. And I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them. I don’t just write code for a CMS; I also write about it.\nFor me, my job and my blog are deeply connected. Every day, I see firsthand how the right CMS makes a newsroom more efficient, helps journalists focus on their work instead of fighting with bad software, and ensures that digital news operations actually generate revenue. And when I see how technology can solve real-world problems, I naturally want to talk about it. That’s why I blog—not just because I love writing, but because my work fuels my passion, and my passion fuels my work.\nSo, What Exactly Is a CMS? Alright, let’s make this simple. A CMS is basically the control center of a website. It lets journalists and editors write, edit, publish, and organize their content without touching a single line of code.\nThink of it like a kitchen. You don’t need to be a chef to make a meal if you’ve got an oven, a knife, and a few good recipes. Same with a CMS—it gives media companies the tools to keep their sites updated, organized, and profitable, without needing a developer for every little change.\nWithout a CMS? Every update is manual. Every layout change is a headache. Every article is a potential disaster waiting to happen. It’s not pretty.\nWhy Should You Care? Even if you don’t run a news site, you’ve probably experienced what happens when a CMS is bad (or nonexistent).\nA painfully slow website (the kind that makes you question all your life choices). Articles impossible to find (why is the latest election update buried under \u0026ldquo;10 Surprising Uses for Olive Oil\u0026rdquo;?). A paywall that feels like a trap (one second you’re reading, the next you’re being asked to hand over your credit card like it’s a ransom demand). A good CMS, though? It keeps everything fast, smooth, and user-friendly. It helps news sites work efficiently while making sure journalists actually get paid.\nAnd that’s exactly what we do at BLOX Digital.\nWhy BLOX Digital? (And Why I’m Excited About BLOX NXT) At BLOX Digital, we don’t just build CMS platforms. We build the CMS platform.\nPowering 2,000+ news sites across the U.S. Serving 6.8 billion pageviews a year Helping media companies stay profitable while keeping journalism accessible How? BLOX CMS – The foundation. This is what keeps content flowing, newsrooms running, and websites from breaking every five minutes. BLOX Audience+ – The smart paywall. Instead of slamming the door in readers’ faces, it nudges them toward subscriptions in a way that makes sense. BLOX YieldUp – Our ad revenue optimizer that helps media companies make money without turning their sites into a mess. But the thing I’m really excited about?\nBLOX NXT: The Future of Digital Publishing BLOX NXT is a complete reimagining of how CMS platforms should work. It’s not just an upgrade—it’s a whole new system.\nReal-time collaboration – No more “this article is locked by another user.” Multiple people can edit at once, like Google Docs but made for journalism. AI-powered tools – Smart tagging, automated recommendations, and workflow optimization so editors spend less time clicking buttons and more time creating content. One-click publishing to multiple platforms – Website, mobile app, social media, email newsletters, even print—all from one place. A modern, intuitive interface – Let’s be real, some CMS dashboards look like they were built in 2005. BLOX NXT looks and feels like it belongs in 2025. And here’s the best part: it’s rolling out now.\nEarly partners are already using BLOX NXT, and the feedback has been outstanding. Editors love the speed and collaboration, media execs love the revenue potential, and developers (like me!) love that it makes content management a whole lot less painful.\nThe Biggest Challenge? It’s Not the Tech—It’s the People. You’d think every media company would jump on this, right? But nope.\nGuy Tasaka, a longtime digital media expert, put it best:\n“All the technology the industry needs to be wildly successful exists today, but the culture won’t let them use it.”\nBasically? The tools are here. The AI-powered automation, the smarter paywalls, the revenue-focused features—they all exist. But some media companies still resist change.\nThey see their websites as expenses instead of investments. They stick to outdated workflows because \u0026ldquo;that’s how we’ve always done it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that’s why BLOX NXT isn’t just about better tech—it’s about making sure journalism can keep up with the digital world.\nThe Bottom Line: My Job and My Blog Are One and the Same I don’t just work on CMS platforms—I believe in them.\nThat’s why I write about them. What I do at BLOX Digital and what I write here are the same thing: helping media companies survive and thrive in the digital age.\nMy work fuels my blog. My blog fuels my passion for my work. It’s all connected.\nNewsrooms don’t have time to waste on bad tech. Readers don’t have patience for clunky websites. And journalism deserves better tools.\nThat’s why BLOX NXT matters. And that’s why I can’t stop talking about it.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/cms-digital-publishing-blox-nxt/","summary":"A CMS isn\u0026rsquo;t just a tool—it\u0026rsquo;s the backbone of digital publishing.

And suddenly, you pause. You squint at the screen, question all your life choices, and wonder why this is even a decision you have to make.\nWell, let me tell you—it is. Because choosing the wrong format can absolutely ruin your image. And you won’t even realize it until it’s too late, like when you zoom in and see that your once-crisp design now looks like it was printed on a cereal box from the ‘90s.\nLet’s get into it.\n1. PNG Keeps Your Image Sharp—JPG Smudges It Like a Greasy Fingerprint You ever seen a JPG up close? It’s not pretty.\nJPG compresses images by basically throwing away data, which means the more you save, the more quality you lose. It’s like making a photocopy of a photocopy—after a while, everything looks a little\u0026hellip; off.\nPNG, on the other hand, keeps everything. Every pixel, every little detail. If you’ve ever saved a screenshot of text as a JPG and then wondered why it suddenly looks like it was written in crayon, you already know the struggle.\nSo, if you care about keeping things crisp, PNG is your best friend.\n2. Transparency. Because Not Everything Needs a White Box Around It. Ever tried saving a logo as a JPG and ended up with an ugly white background? Yeah. That’s because JPG doesn’t do transparency.\nPNG? Perfectly clean, invisible backgrounds.\nThis is huge if you’re working with logos, icons, or anything you need to layer over other images. If you’re making graphics and saving them as JPGs, you’re basically giving yourself extra work because now you have to go back and remove that stupid white box.\nOr, you know, just use PNG from the start and save yourself the headache.\n3. PNG Keeps Text and Sharp Lines Looking Sharp—JPG Butchers Them JPG has a bad habit of turning sharp edges into blurry, blocky nonsense. Letters, graphs, clean vector lines—it all gets smudged like someone took their thumb and rubbed it across the screen.\nIf you’re making infographics, charts, UI elements, or anything with text, stick with PNG. Otherwise, you’ll zoom in and wonder why your carefully designed text now looks like it was pulled from an old fax machine.\nAnd no, increasing the JPG quality to 100% won’t completely fix it. That’s like putting a band-aid on a broken bone.\n4. Color Gradients Stay Smooth in PNG—JPG Turns Them Into a Stripey Mess You ever seen an image where a soft color gradient turns into a series of ugly bands instead of a smooth transition? That’s JPG compression at work.\nPNG keeps all the subtle color details, while JPG tries to “simplify” them, which is just a fancy way of saying “ruins them.”\nIf you’re working on art, backgrounds, or anything with a soft color fade, don’t even think about saving as JPG. Unless you like your images looking like they came from an early 2000s PowerPoint slide.\n5. You Can Save PNG Over and Over Without Losing Quality—JPG Degrades Every Time JPG is like a VHS tape. Every time you copy, edit, and save it, the quality gets worse.\nPNG? Doesn’t budge.\nThis is huge if you’re working on something that requires multiple edits. Save as PNG, and you’ll always have a clean, perfect file. Save as JPG, and after a few rounds, you’ll be looking at something that resembles abstract art—but not in a good way.\nAlso, if you’re archiving old photos, PNG is the way to go. Because one day, Future You is gonna open that JPG and ask, “Why does this look like a pixelated disaster?”\nBut Wait—When Is JPG Actually Better? Look, JPG isn’t evil. It’s just… situational.\nIf you’re dealing with big photos and need to save space, JPG is fine. It’s great for sharing images on the web, sending memes, or saving a bunch of random pictures that don’t need to be perfect.\nBut if you’re working with logos, text, sharp details, or anything you want to keep pristine, PNG is the move.\nFinal Thoughts So next time you’re about to hit \u0026ldquo;Save As,\u0026rdquo; ask yourself: Do I care about transparency? Do I need sharp edges? Will I be editing this later? If the answer to any of those is yes, PNG all the way.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-save-images-as-png-instead-of-jpg/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo, you’re about to save an image, and that little dropdown asks: \u003cstrong\u003ePNG or JPG?\u003c/strong\u003e And suddenly, you pause.

This is the one?\nBecause for the longest time, I didn’t.\nMoving to New York, I figured finding good bread would be easy.\nI mean, it’s NYC! Home of the best bagels, killer pizza, and a food scene that never sleeps.\nBut Italian-style bread? That was a different story.\nToo Soft, Too Sweet, Too… Tasteless? The problem? Every loaf I bought was either:\n1️⃣ Too soft—like, pillow soft. Great for Wonder Bread fans, but not exactly the crusty, chewy Italian bread I grew up with.\n2️⃣ Too sweet—I don’t know why, but a lot of bread here has this weird sugary aftertaste. Bread shouldn’t taste like cake.\n3️⃣ Too tasteless—Some loaves looked great, all golden and rustic, but as soon as I took a bite\u0026hellip; nothing. Just air and disappointment.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the prices.\nArtisan bakeries? Amazing.\nBut unless I wanted to take out a loan for a daily bread habit, I needed another solution.\nA Christmas Surprise (And a Game Changer) Enter: My Wife, The Genius.\nLast Christmas, B (my wife) surprised me with a bread machine.\nHonestly? I wasn’t expecting it.\nI’d casually (let’s say \u0026ldquo;casually\u0026rdquo;) complained:\nHow expensive good bread was. How nothing tasted quite right. How I wished I could just make my own. Apparently, she got tired of hearing me complain because—boom! Bread machine under the tree.\n(I love you, B ❤️)\nNow, I’d love to say my first loaf came out perfect.\nThat I threw in some flour, hit a button, and created a masterpiece.\nBut let’s be real—it was a disaster.\nDense. Heavy. The kind of loaf you’d keep by the door in case of an emergency.\n(Intruder? Bam—bread to the head.)\nTurns out, bread flour and regular flour are NOT the same thing.\nBread Flour vs. Regular Flour (And the Quest for Manitoba) In Italy, we don’t have a special “bread flour” on supermarket shelves.\nInstead, we mix regular flour with Manitoba flour, which is high in protein and gives bread its structure.\nSimple, right?\nWell, try finding Manitoba flour in New York.\nI dare you. It’s like hunting for truffles.\nEventually, I cracked the code:\n✔ Just buy bread flour. Problem solved.\nBut then I had another discovery—one that changed everything:\nSemolina: The Secret Weapon The first time I added semolina flour to my dough, I swear I heard angels singing.\n✔ The crust had that snap.\n✔ The inside had more flavor.\n✔ The whole loaf just felt… right.\nNot easy to find, but totally worth the effort.\nAnd that’s the thing—bread-making is all about little improvements.\nI love the loaves I’m making now, but I know they’ll get even better.\nMaybe I’ll tweak the hydration. Maybe I’ll try a longer rise. Who knows? Is It Cheaper? Well… Kinda. Let’s talk cost.\nMaking bread at home isn’t free.\nGood flour isn’t cheap.\nAnd yeah, the machine itself was an investment (thanks again, B 😘).\nBut\u0026hellip;\n✔ Is it as expensive as buying from an artisan bakery every week? Nope.\n✔ Is it way better than supermarket bread? Absolutely.\n✔ Does it take more than four minutes of effort? Not really.\nFour minutes to throw ingredients in, press a button, and then just wait.\nThat’s it.\n✔ No kneading.\n✔ No babysitting dough.\n✔ Just a little patience.\nAnd the best part? My house smells like a bakery every time.\nThe Never-Ending Bread Journey So here I am, an Italian guy in NYC, still tweaking, learning, experimenting—\nBut finally—finally—happy with my bread.\nAnd if I ever move again (hey, it’s happened before), at least I know one thing:\nGood bread isn’t something you find.

No algorithms, no distractions, no social media noise—just a place I actually controlled.\nAt first, I went with Jekyll because it was GitHub Pages’ default. It worked… until it didn’t.\nJekyll was like an old car—reliable but constantly needing maintenance. The issues kept piling up:\nSlow build times – A simple edit? Better grab a coffee. Ruby dependencies – Installing Jekyll felt like summoning a demon. Outdated themes – I wanted something modern, not a blog that looked straight out of 2012. I tried alternatives:\nGhost – Overkill for a simple blog. WordPress – Too bloated. Eleventy – Cool, but required too much setup. Pelican – Python-based, but didn’t click with me. Then I found Hugo—fast, simple, and didn’t make me question my life choices.\nWhy I Stuck with GitHub Pages I kept everything on GitHub Pages because:\nIt’s free – No hosting costs. Free is always good. Automatic updates – Every Git commit deploys the site instantly. Easy domain linking – My Namecheap domain worked without hassle. No maintenance – No server issues, no software updates. Just write and publish. Version control built-in – I can roll back changes if I break something (which happens often). With Hugo + GitHub Pages, I could focus on writing instead of debugging my blog.\nStep 1: Installing Hugo (For Once, a Smooth Setup) Unlike Jekyll, which requires bundle install and a blood sacrifice, Hugo is just a single binary.\nOn macOS:\nbrew install hugo\nOn Windows: Download it from Hugo’s GitHub releases and add it to your PATH.\nOn Linux:\nsudo apt install hugo\nTo verify the installation:\nhugo version\rThat’s it. No Bundler, no dependencies, no cursing at my screen.\nStep 2: Moving My Jekyll Posts (This Should Have Been Easy, But…) At first, I thought I could just copy my Markdown files into Hugo’s content/posts/ folder, and everything would work.\nIt didn’t.\nWhat Broke? Folder structure – Jekyll stores posts in _posts/, but Hugo expects them in content/posts/. Front matter differences – Jekyll uses YAML, but Hugo supports TOML, YAML, or JSON. Permalinks – Jekyll and Hugo structure URLs differently. To move the posts:\nmkdir -p content/posts\rmv _posts/* content/posts/\rThen, I had to clean up the front matter:\nfind content/posts -type f -name \u0026quot;*.\rmd\u0026quot; -exec sed -i 's/layout: post//g' {} \\;\rThat was when I realized: Markdown is Markdown… until it isn’t.\nStep 3: Choosing a Theme (A Black Hole of Decision Making) I tested multiple themes before settling on PaperMod:\nMainroad – Clean, but too plain. Anubis – A dark theme with style, but not quite what I wanted. Hello-Friend – Nice, but missing features I needed. PaperMod – Minimalist, fast, and easy to tweak. Installing PaperMod was simple:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod\rThen, I updated config.toml:\ntheme = \u0026quot;PaperMod\u0026quot;\rFor now, it works. But I’ll probably keep tweaking things forever.\nStep 4: Fixing My Broken Blog (Because of Course It Was Broken) I ran:\nhugo server -D\r…and was immediately greeted by broken links, missing images, and general chaos.\nWhat Went Wrong? Jekyll’s /assets/ folder didn’t move – I had to copy it manually. Relative links broke – Hugo handles them differently than Jekyll. Markdown formatting was stricter – Sloppy formatting? Not happening. After fixing those, my site finally worked.\nStep 5: Deploying to GitHub Pages (This Also Should Have Been Easy, But…) Since I was sticking with GitHub Pages, I had to tweak my deployment process.\nRun Hugo’s build command\nhugo\rThis generates a public/ folder with the static files.\nPush to GitHub\ncd public\rgit initgit add .git commit -m \u0026quot;Deploy Hugo site\u0026quot;\rgit push origin main\rAt first, I manually deployed, but I eventually set up GitHub Actions to automate everything.\nStep 6: Customizing PaperMod (Because I Can’t Leave Things Alone) Enable Dark Mode [params] defaultTheme = \u0026quot;dark\u0026quot;\rEnable Search [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]\rCustomize Sidebar Profile [params.profileMode] enabled = true title = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;Minimalist, Developer, Writer\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;images/profile.jpg\u0026quot;\rEvery time I think I’m done tweaking, I find something else to change.\nWas It Worth It? Hugo is fast – My site builds in milliseconds instead of making me wait. No more Ruby dependencies – No bundle exec, no errors, no wasted time. PaperMod works out of the box – A rare theme that doesn’t require days of customization. What I’d Do Differently Plan URL redirects better. My old Jekyll links broke, and I had to fix them manually. Test locally before pushing. I pushed broken pages more than once. Take notes while migrating. Some mistakes could have been avoided if I had written things down. Why I’ll Keep Blogging This whole migration wasn’t just about switching platforms.\nA personal blog is like a journal – It helps me organize my thoughts. It’s my escape from social media – No ads, no distractions, no algorithm deciding what gets seen. It’s mine, forever – No company can shadowban or de-platform me. I don’t know if PaperMod will be my final theme. I don’t know if I’ll keep tweaking every little thing.\nWhat I do know is this:\nI like writing. I like experimenting. And I like having a space that’s truly mine.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of switching to Hugo, do it. Just be ready for the unexpected.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-switched-from-jekyll-to-hugo-and-why-you-might-too\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I Switched from Jekyll to Hugo (And Why You Might Too)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started blogging last summer because I wanted my own space on the internet.

No idea.\nMy brain has this incredible ability to cling to completely useless information while ruthlessly discarding the things I actually need.\nI’ve spent years searching for a way to keep my thoughts, projects, and tasks organized. I tried:\n✔ Sticky notes (good luck finding them when I actually need them\u0026hellip; they vanish into another dimension).\n✔ To-do list apps (too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week).\n✔ Google Docs (a black hole where ideas go to die).\n✔ My own memory (don’t even ask).\nNothing worked.\nThen I stumbled upon Notion, and suddenly, my brain had a backup system.\nWhy Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed) I’ve always been skeptical of “all-in-one” productivity tools.\nEvery app promises to be the last one you’ll ever need—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think.\nNotion is the first one that actually adapts to me.\nIt’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once.

My meetings are on video calls.\nThe only time I’d need offline notes is if I were stuck in a cabin with no internet—and at that point, I have bigger problems than note-taking.\nLike figuring out how to survive without Stack Overflow.\nFor my actual, daily reality, Notion’s always-online approach isn’t a limitation.\nIt’s just how I already work.\nThe Takeaway I didn’t think I needed Notion.\nI thought I just needed to be more disciplined or find the “right” system to organize my thoughts. I assumed I was just bad at remembering things, and that was that.\nBut now? I can’t imagine functioning without it.\nIf you’ve ever felt like your thoughts are scattered across a dozen places, if you struggle to remember things you actually need, if you’ve tried every productivity tool and nothing stuck—\nNotion might be exactly what your brain has been waiting for.\nAnd unlike my real brain, it actually remembers things.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/notion-external-brain-that-works-for-me/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor most of my life, I’ve been at war with \u003cstrong\u003emy own memory\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m great at solving problems, debugging complex code, and figuring out tricky logic flows.

Multitasking isn’t a productivity hack. It’s a scam.\nAnd worse? It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.\nThe Hidden Cost of Doing It All We live in a world that worships multitasking.\n🖥 Job descriptions praise it.\n📈 Productivity gurus preach it.\n📱 If you’re not multitasking, you’re “falling behind.”\nBut science—and my own experience—beg to differ.\nMultitasking isn’t actually doing two things at once.\nIt’s rapid task-switching.\nAnd every time you switch, your brain pays a price.\nJumping between Slack messages and writing code? You’re not doubling your output—you’re introducing micro-delays that slow you down. Checking your phone while spending time with family? You’re mentally buffering between two worlds—never fully present in either. I used to think multitasking kept me ahead.\nBut it was actually the thing keeping me stuck.\nI was always busy but never truly productive.\nThen, I read something that hit me like a brick:\n“The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.” And that’s when everything changed.\nSo Here’s What I’m Doing Instead I’ve started embracing single-tasking like my productivity depends on it—because it does.\n1. Time-Blocking 2.0 I used to schedule my day down to the minute.\nIt only made me stressed when things didn’t go as planned.\nNow, I align tasks with my actual energy levels:\n✔ High-focus work when my brain is sharp.\n✔ Low-focus tasks when I’m running on fumes.\nIt’s about working with my brain, not against it.\n2. Digital Decluttering I used to think a million open tabs meant I was working hard.\nNope.\nIt just meant I was distracted.\nNow, I:\n✔ Close unused tabs.\n✔ Write down what I actually need.\n✔ Handle tasks one at a time.\nIf something’s important, it goes on my Notion board.\nIf it’s not? It’s gone.\n3. The “One-Tab Rule” If my brain wants a second tab, it means I need a second task slot later—not now.\nThis was tough as a developer.\nI’m used to juggling:\n✔ Documentation\n✔ Stack Overflow threads\n✔ My IDE\nBut once I stopped, my focus got sharper.\n4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth Instead of half-absorbing five articles, I read one properly—and actually retain something.\n✔ No more fake productivity.\n✔ No more information overload.\nThe result?\n✔ Deeper focus.\n✔ Lower stress.\n✔ Better work.\n✔ Actually being present in my own life.\nThe Takeaway We’ve been sold the lie that multitasking is the key to success.\nBut what if the real key is the opposite?\nImagine a world where we:\n✔ Stop bragging about being busy.\n✔ Start taking pride in how well we do one thing at a time.\nImagine how different life would feel.\nI’m not perfect at it yet.\nI still catch myself falling back into old habits:\n✔ Checking messages while pushing code.\n✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.\nBut now, I notice it.\nI stop.\nI refocus.\nI’m done with the chaos.\nAre you?

It worked.\nI was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.\nBut then something strange happened.\nDespite all my so-called productivity, I felt like I was going nowhere.\n❌ Busy, but not fulfilled.\n❌ Efficient, but not effective.\n❌ Always working, but never actually moving forward.\nAnd that’s when I realized: The way we think about productivity is broken.\nThe False Promise of “Getting More Done” Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a lie:\n🛑 That the key to success is efficiency.\n🛑 That if we just optimize our time perfectly, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.\nBut here’s the truth:\nProductivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the right things done. And if you’re not careful, “being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.\nI call it The Productivity Trap.\nHow The Productivity Trap Works This is how most people approach work:\n1️⃣ You feel overwhelmed. Too much to do, not enough time.\n2️⃣ You try to optimize. Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.\n3️⃣ You get efficient\u0026hellip; at the wrong things. Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually matters.\n4️⃣ You stay stuck in a loop of busyness. Always “doing,” never really progressing.\nThis is the scary part:\nProductivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion. And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.\nI was checking boxes but not moving forward.\nI was working hard but not working smart.\nI was busy—but not productive.\nThe Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition I used to ask myself:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?\u0026rdquo;\nNow, I ask a better question:\n\u0026ldquo;What can I remove?\u0026rdquo;\nReal productivity isn’t about adding more tasks.\nIt’s about:\n✔ Eliminating distractions.\n✔ Cutting useless work.\n✔ Focusing on what actually moves the needle.\nHere’s how I flipped my mindset:\n1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant I used to spend hours tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.\nIt felt productive, but in reality? It was just procrastination in disguise.\nNow, I ask:\nDoes this task even matter? Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy? Most of the time, the best way to be more productive is to stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.\n2. The 80/20 Focus Shift The Pareto Principle says 80% of results come from 20% of effort.\nBut most of us spend time on the 80% of tasks that don’t actually move the needle.\nSo instead of asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nI ask:\n✔ What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?\n✔ What can I cut without any real consequence?\nThen, I ruthlessly focus on the high-impact 20%—and let go of the rest.\nThis was a game-changer for me. It’s not about doing everything. It’s about doing the right things.\n3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower I used to pride myself on multitasking.\nBut multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.\nIt’s just rapidly switching between tasks, losing focus each time.\nNow, I do the opposite:\n✔ One tab at a time. No distractions.\n✔ One task at a time. Full focus, deep work.\n✔ One decision at a time. No jumping back and forth.\nIt feels slower, but in reality? It’s 10x more effective.\n4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule Most people try to do everything at 70% effort.\nThey spread themselves too thin, and their work suffers.\nBut the real magic happens when you:\n✔ Do fewer things, but do them exceptionally well.\n✔ Say no to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.\n✔ Focus on quality over quantity.\nIronically, by doing less, you achieve more.\nThe Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output The biggest shift I made?\nI stopped measuring productivity by how much I do.\nInstead, I measure it by:\n✔ How much progress I make on things that actually matter.\n✔ How much energy I have left at the end of the day.\n✔ How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.\nI stopped asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do more?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd started asking:\n\u0026ldquo;How can I do less, but better?\u0026rdquo;\nIf You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This If you’ve been optimizing, planning, and working harder—but still feel stuck?\nTry the opposite.\n✔ Instead of doing more, do less—strategically.\n✔ Instead of working harder, work on the right things.\n✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, chase clarity.\nBecause the most productive people aren’t the ones who get the most done.\nThey’re the ones who do what matters—and ignore everything else.\nThat’s the secret.\nIt’s not about doing more.\nIt’s about doing less—but doing it better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity-trap-why-doing-more-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductivity was about doing more.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✔ More tasks.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More efficiency.\u003cbr\u003e\n✔ More checkboxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn’t constantly \u003cstrong\u003eoptimizing, planning, and squeezing every second\u003c/strong\u003e for maximum output, I was failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at first? \u003cstrong\u003eIt worked.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting things done.

But this time?\nI let it stay.\nAt first, it felt weird—like my own face was betraying me.

There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more deliberate. Like I had made a choice, even if that choice was just to\u0026hellip; not shave.

I wasn’t prepared for how much other people would comment on it. It was like I had changed something huge, when all I did was\u0026hellip; nothing.\nAnd every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of pride and discomfort. Like I was being seen in a new way—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.\nWhat I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing Growing a beard didn’t change my life.\nBut it did make me realize something important.\nSo many of the things we believe about ourselves—our “defaults”—aren’t actually rules. They’re just habits.\nFor years, I thought:\n✔ I’m a clean-shaven guy.\n✔ Beards don’t suit me.\n✔ This is just how I look.\nAnd then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” disappeared.\nIt made me wonder:\nHow many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?\nI’m not a morning person.

Everything I do is digital.\nAnd yet, whenever I need to truly think, whenever I need to solve a problem, I reach for something ancient.\nPaper.\nYes, real, dead-tree, old-school paper. With an actual pen. No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.\nWhy Do I Do This? People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?\u0026rdquo;\nI tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.\nBut every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.\nWith paper, I can:\nThink freely without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications. Draw connections with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate. Physically slow down, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving. I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because it works.\nThe Problem with Digital Thinking I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:\nThey make everything too neat.\nTyping forces you into a linear thought process. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.\nBut real problem-solving? It’s messy.\nIt’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.\nDigital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.\nWhen I write on paper, I’m not editing as I think. I’m letting ideas collide, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.\nPaper is My Debugging Tool For some people, thinking happens on the keyboard.\nFor me, thinking happens with a pen.\nIt’s not just about notes—it’s about clarity. It’s about processing. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.\nBefore I write code, I write on paper. I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture. Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out. I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster. Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page. I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios. By the time I finally touch the keyboard, I already know what I’m doing.\nThe Takeaway People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job isn’t the newest or the most advanced—it’s just the one that works.\nNo productivity hack replaces thinking.\nNo app mimics messy creativity.\nNo digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.\nSo yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.\nBut also? Watch me solve problems faster than you.\nBecause in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues.

I eliminate them.\nI’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale mission to find the absolute best—the one perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.\n✔ One backpack.\n✔ One pen.\n✔ One pencil.\n✔ One bathroom set.\nEverything I own must be the best, the most compact, the most portable.\nWhy? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.\n🔹 Not as objects, but as decisions.\nI don’t want five backpacks—I want one that does it all.\nI don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want one that feels perfect in my hand.\nI don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world.\nThis isn’t just minimalism.\nIt’s ruthless optimization.\nThe Rules of the Game Finding The One is an art form. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.\n1️⃣ Compactness is king. If it’s too bulky, it’s out. Portability without sacrifice.\n2️⃣ One item, zero regrets. Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. This is my Excalibur.\n3️⃣ Quality over everything. If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. No disposable junk.\n4️⃣ No over-engineered nonsense. If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I don’t want it. Keep it simple, durable, and effective.\nThis isn’t about being cheap. It’s about investing in the best, once—and then never thinking about it again.\nThe Search is Brutal You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.\nFinding the one perfect item in any category means sifting through a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right options.\nThe best backpack? Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats. The best pen? Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream pretentious fountain pen guy. Found it. But wait—should I test one more? The best toothbrush? Yes, even this is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. Why is this so hard? Each decision is a battle. A war between function and obsession.\nAnd the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.\n❌ “This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”\n❌ “This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”\n❌ “This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”\nI fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make spreadsheets with pros and cons.\nYes, I’m that person.\nWhy I Love This Insanity Some people call it overthinking.\nI call it engineering my life for efficiency.\nBecause once I’ve chosen The One, I’m free.\n✅ No more switching.\n✅ No more rebuying.\n✅ No more second-guessing.\nJust one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.\nIt’s about reducing decision fatigue. It’s about knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me. It’s about portability, mobility, and adaptability.\nIt’s also about being prepared.\nI’ve moved across continents multiple times. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the freedom of traveling light and the nightmare of clutter.\nSo when the next big move happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.\n❌ No clutter.\n❌ No baggage.\n✅ Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.\nThe Final Boss Battle of Minimalism I’m not naive.\nI know The One doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.\nBut the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about the mindset.\nIt’s about curating my life to be as efficient and effective as possible. It’s about choosing quality over quantity in every decision.\nSo if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the final boss battle of minimalism.\nAnd when I finally find The One?\n✔ I’ll stop looking.\n✔ Until the next perfect version comes out. 😉\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/pursuit-of-perfect-quest-for-ultimate-everything/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003cstrong\u003ecollect things\u003c/strong\u003e.

Instead, I use a mix of simple tricks and mental hacks to keep myself productive.\nOne task at a time. Multitasking? I quit that. If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing nothing. Writing everything down. My memory is unreliable, so I put everything in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it. The Two-Minute Rule. If something takes less than two minutes, I do it right away. Otherwise, it disappears into “I’ll do it later” (which means never). Multiple timers. Since I forget I set a timer, I use two or three different ones. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer! Using my deep focus. When my brain decides something is THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned. But the most important thing?\nI Work With My Brain, Not Against It I stopped trying to use systems made for other people. I can’t force focus, but I can catch it when it happens.\nIf I suddenly get super focused on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I write them all down and organize them later.\nMy productivity is not straightforward. It moves in all directions. And that’s okay.\nThe Tools That (Sometimes) Help Notion: My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion. Post-it Notes: Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere. Timers (Lots of Them): On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. At least one might help me. Single-tasking mode: One window. One tab. One job. If I open a second tab, it means I need to do it later. Solid Starts: Yes, even for feeding my son. Because focus problems don’t take a break when you’re a parent. The Takeaway Yes, my brain is chaotic. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have a small collection of abandoned productivity tools.\nBut at the end of the day? I get things done.\nNot in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in my way.\nBecause sometimes, thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.\nSo if you ever see me staring at the screen, just know:\nI might be solving a complicated problem\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.

I build things for the web. I write code.\nI understand how browsers work.\nAnd yet, somehow, choosing a default browser nearly broke me.\nIt wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. It’s just a browser.\nA glorified tab holder. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.\nBut the moment I tried to pick the one—the browser that would rule them all—I descended into a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.\nRound 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison) I thought I had a choice.\nI really did.\nI believed I could just install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone and live a normal life.\nWhat a fool I was.\nBecause Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you use a real browser on iOS.\nNo matter what I install—Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels—they’re all WebKit underneath.\nWhich means every browser on iPhone is just Safari wearing a cheap disguise.\nChrome? Safari with Google Sync. Firefox? Safari with different branding. Brave? Safari with a tinfoil hat. There is no escape. Safari is the law.\nI tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, convincing myself it was different.\nIt wasn’t.\nThe pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.\nThe only difference? A Google logo and more tracking.\nAt some point, I accepted my fate. If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.\nFine. Safari wins on iPhone.\nNot because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a slow, battery-draining death.\nRound 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway) On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. Freedom.\nOr so I thought.\nIn reality, every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.\nChrome – The original Chromium overlord. Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist. Brave – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto? Vivaldi – For people who think customizing a browser is a personality trait. Opera – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? Reveal yourselves. Firefox – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off, and the font rendering gives me trust issues. At this point, I realized something horrifying.\nEvery time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.\nNot because I wanted to, but because the entire web is optimized for Chromium.\nI wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that the slightly-off fonts were a feature.\nBut in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.\nSo, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use the version that’s optimized for Windows and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.\nAnd that’s how Edge won by default.\nRound 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together) So now I had:\nSafari on iPhone (because Apple won’t let me have nice things). Edge on Windows (because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better). But now came the real problem.\nHow do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?\nGoogle wants me to use Chrome on everything like some kind of cross-platform cult. Apple wants me to use Safari on everything because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone. Microsoft wants me to embrace Edge fully and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it. I refused to let any of them win.\nSo I hacked my way out with iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.\nNow Safari and Edge share bookmarks like two kids forced to get along. I don’t need Google. I don’t need third-party syncing tools. And best of all, I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks. Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie After all this research, testing, and questioning my life choices, I have one conclusion:\nAll browsers are terrible.\nSome track you aggressively. Some drain your battery. Some crash randomly. Some make you feel guilty for using them. But in the end? A browser is just a tool.\nThe best one is the one that gets in your way the least.\nFor me, that means:\n✔ Safari on iPhone (because fighting Apple is exhausting).\n✔ Edge on Windows (because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration).\n✔ iCloud Sync (because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks).\nIs it perfect? No.\nIs it better than switching browsers every week? Yes.\nWill I probably change my mind in six months?

Push through resistance. Be disciplined.\nI told myself, “Just do it. No excuses.”\nAnd for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.\nBut then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.\nAnd every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.\nThen I learned something that changed everything:\nWe don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Trying Harder\u0026rdquo; Never Works Think about this:\nTwo people are offered a cigarette.\nThe first person says, “No thanks, I’m trying to quit.” The second person says, “No thanks, I don’t smoke.” The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.\nThe first person is using willpower—constantly resisting. The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted. That’s why most habits fail.\nWe focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.\nThe Identity-Based Approach to Change Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.\nEvery action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.\nIf I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person. If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer. If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges. I had to stop seeing habits as things I do and start seeing them as things that define who I am.\nHow I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change I started with small identity shifts:\nInstead of “I should exercise more,” I tell myself “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.” Instead of “I need to focus better,” I remind myself “I’m someone who works with deep focus.” Instead of “I need to stop procrastinating,” I say “I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.” At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:\nThe brain hates cognitive dissonance.\nWhen you tell yourself you are something, you subconsciously start acting like it.\nIf I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day. If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes. If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character. It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.\nThe Difference Between Trying and Being I used to say:\n“I’m trying to exercise more.” “I’m trying to focus better.” “I’m trying to wake up earlier.” Now I say:\n“I’m a person who moves every day.” “I’m someone who works with focus.” “I’m the kind of person who gets up early.” The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.\nAnd identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.\nThe Takeaway Willpower is unreliable.\nMotivation fades.\nBut identity sticks.\nIf you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.\nStart with who you are.\nWant to read more? Become a reader. Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health. Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it. Because the truth is:\nWe don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.\nChange who you are, and the actions will follow.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-we-struggle-to-change-simple-fix-that-works/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think change was about willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder.

Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter We’ve all said it:\n“I just need to get motivated.” “I’ll start when I feel ready.” “I don’t have the energy today.” But motivation isn’t something you have—it’s something you create.\nWe think action comes after motivation, when really, it’s the other way around.\nMotivation follows action, not the other way around. You don’t wait to feel inspired before starting.\nYou start, and then inspiration finds you.\nOnce I figured this out, everything changed.\nI used to wait for that perfect wave of motivation—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.\nThen I noticed something:\nI always felt more motivated after I started, not before. Even if I didn’t feel like it—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.\nThat’s when I realized:\nMotivation is a side effect of action. What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple) If I waited to feel motivated, I’d never do anything.\nSo instead, I follow three simple rules that make action inevitable:\n1. The 5-Minute Rule If something feels overwhelming, I trick my brain by saying:\n✔ I’ll just do it for five minutes. That’s it.\nToo tired to work out? → Five minutes of exercise. Don’t want to start that project? → Five minutes of brainstorming. Can’t focus on writing? → Five minutes of bad first drafts. 90% of the time, I keep going.\nBecause starting is the hardest part. Once I’m in motion, momentum keeps me moving.\nAnd if I really do stop after five minutes?\nAt least I did something—and something is infinitely better than nothing.\n2. The “No Emotion” Rule I stopped asking myself if I felt like doing something.\nFeelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d never get anything done.\nSo I stopped negotiating with myself.\nNow, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. No debates. No negotiations.\nIt’s just what I do.\n✔ Exercise? → It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”\n✔ Writing? → Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”\n✔ Starting work? → Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”\nAction first. Feelings later.\nSurprisingly, once I start, motivation usually shows up.\nAnd if it doesn’t? Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.\n3. The 3-Choice Trick When I don’t want to do something, I limit my options to just three:\n1️⃣ Do it now. (Just start, even if it’s imperfect.)\n2️⃣ Do it badly. (Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.)\n3️⃣ Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.\nTurns out, staring at a wall is boring. So I usually just do the thing.\nThis trick works because it eliminates all distractions.\nI’m not allowed to scroll on my phone or check social media.\nMy only choices?\n✔ Work.\n✔ Do it badly.\n✔ Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.\nAnd honestly? Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.\nWhy This Works: The Science of Momentum Newton’s First Law of Motion states:\n“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.” Turns out, this applies to humans too.\nWhen we’re at rest (not doing the thing), it feels impossible to get moving.\nBut once we start, it’s easier to keep going.\nThis is why the hardest part of any task is getting started.\nIt’s why the 5-minute rule works so well.\n✔ It breaks the inertia.\n✔ It removes overthinking.\n✔ It makes starting feel effortless.\nAnd once you’re moving? Momentum takes over.\nIt’s not about willpower.\nIt’s about tricking your brain into motion.\nThe Takeaway Motivation is a trap. It’s not coming to save you. If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.\nIf you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.\nBut action? Action leads to momentum.\nAnd momentum creates motivation.\nSo next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.\n✔ Start for five minutes. (Even if it’s terrible.)\n✔ Do it without debating. (Feelings can catch up later.)\n✔ Give yourself only three choices. (Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.)\nBecause once you start, you won’t stop.\nAnd when you stop needing motivation to begin, you’ll get more done than ever before.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/motivation-myth-why-waiting-keeps-you-stuck/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years, I waited for \u003cstrong\u003emotivation to strike\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought \u003cstrong\u003eproductive people\u003c/strong\u003e had some kind of \u003cstrong\u003emagical drive\u003c/strong\u003e I didn’t.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat one day, I’d wake up \u003cstrong\u003efull of energy\u003c/strong\u003e, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects \u003cstrong\u003ewithout procrastinating\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day \u003cstrong\u003enever came.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it never \u003cem\u003ewill.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here’s the truth:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck"},{"content":"Some people think changing your mind is a weakness—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That certainty equals strength and doubt makes you unreliable.\nI completely disagree.\nI change my mind all the time. Not because I’m indecisive, but because I’m learning.\nThe Art of Arguing With Yourself It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, your brain worked hard to form it.\nAnd then, suddenly\u0026hellip; doubt creeps in.\nYou start thinking about the opposite perspective. You challenge your own logic. You realize, maybe I was missing something.\nSome people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.\nI’ve realized that my opinions are just snapshots of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need updates.\nI constantly ask myself:\nWhat if I’m wrong? What am I not considering? How would someone who disagrees with me see this? I argue against my own beliefs to test their strength. I look for holes in my logic.\nThis isn’t being indecisive. This is debugging my own thinking.\nAnd every time I find a flaw, I fix it. I upgrade.\nMarriage: The Ultimate Debate Club If you want practice in changing your mind, get married.\nMy wife and I love to debate. Not argue—debate.\nIt starts with small things:\nIs this really the best way to load the dishwasher? Is a hot dog a sandwich? Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again? Then, two hours later, we’re deep into life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.\nAnd sometimes, we completely switch sides.\nNot because one of us \u0026ldquo;won.\u0026rdquo;\nNot because we’re trying to be \u0026ldquo;right.\u0026rdquo;\nBut because we actually listened to each other.\nBecause seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.\nAnd yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.\n(Okay, often she’s right, but that’s another story.)\nBut every time I admit I was wrong, I get smarter.\nAnd every time she does, we both grow.\nWhy Changing Your Mind is a Superpower Here’s what I’ve learned:\nIf you never change your mind, you’re not learning. You’re just repeating yourself. Admitting you were wrong doesn’t make you weak. It makes you someone people actually trust. The smartest people aren’t the ones who refuse to budge. They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas. Think about it:\nEvery time you change your mind, it means you’ve learned something new.\nScience evolves by questioning and updating its ideas. Great leaders adjust their strategies when new information comes in. Successful people don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow. Changing your mind doesn’t mean you were stupid before.\nIt means you’re smarter now.\nIt doesn’t mean you were wrong.\nIt means you’ve improved.\nAnd over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles the truth.\nVersion 2.0 (And Beyond) I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.\nNow, I see it as a sign of growth.\nI don’t want to be version 1.0 of myself forever.\nI want to be 2.0, 3.0, 10.0—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.\nSome people are proud of being \u0026ldquo;consistent.\u0026rdquo; But if you’re consistent just for the sake of consistency, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.\nPeople who never change their minds? They’re frozen in time.\nPeople who adapt, question, and rethink? They’re evolving.\nAnd that means being willing to say,\n\u0026ldquo;I was wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I learned something new.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nIt means embracing doubt, curiosity, and growth.\nThe Takeaway People think strength is about sticking to your guns no matter what.\nBut real strength? Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.\nIt’s about:\nBeing curious enough to question yourself. Being humble enough to admit when you’re wrong. Being smart enough to see doubt as a tool for growth. So the next time someone accuses you of flip-flopping, don’t take it as an insult.\nTake it as proof that you’re evolving.\nBecause the strongest minds?\nThey’re the ones that never stop upgrading.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSome people think \u003cstrong\u003echanging your mind is a weakness\u003c/strong\u003e—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever.

Classic exhaustion, right?\nSo I did what everyone does: chugged coffee, tried to sleep more, and powered through.\nBut no matter what I did, the fatigue never went away.\nI blamed it on parenthood. On work. On stress. I figured, \u0026ldquo;This is just adulthood. Everyone is tired.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I realized something.\nI wasn’t just physically exhausted. I was mentally overloaded, emotionally drained, creatively empty.\nAnd no amount of caffeine or extra sleep could fix it.\nBecause we don’t just have one type of energy—so we don’t just get tired in one way.\nThe 5 Types of Exhaustion (And Why We Ignore Them) 1. Mental Exhaustion (The Overloaded Brain) Too many tabs open (in your browser and your head). Constant context-switching. Information overload. You sit down to work and suddenly forget what you were supposed to do.\nSymptoms: Brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to focus, procrastination. 2. Emotional Exhaustion (The Feeling Drain) When your emotions are on overdrive—too many decisions, too many worries, too much social pressure. Even small conversations feel like heavy lifting.\nSymptoms: Irritability, feeling overwhelmed, emotional numbness, quick to snap. 3. Creative Exhaustion (The Empty Tank) The silent killer of inspiration. When your brain has been in \u0026lsquo;output mode\u0026rsquo; for too long without enough input. You stare at a blank screen, and your best idea is… nothing.\nSymptoms: Writer’s block, lack of ideas, feeling uninspired, repetitive thinking. 4. Social Exhaustion (The People Drain) It’s not about being an introvert or extrovert—it’s about too much social interaction (or the wrong kind). Even replying to a text feels like a chore.\nSymptoms: Social avoidance, feeling drained after interactions, irritability in social settings. 5. Sensory Exhaustion (The Overstimulation Overload) Noise, notifications, screens, flashing lights. Your brain is constantly processing micro-stimuli, and it never shuts up.\nSymptoms: Feeling agitated by noise, craving silence, overstimulation, physical restlessness. Why We Stay Exhausted (Even When We Rest) Here’s the problem: we treat them all the same way.\nMental exhaustion? We take a break—but then scroll through social media, keeping our brain in overdrive. Emotional exhaustion? We binge-watch Netflix, numbing our feelings instead of processing them. Creative exhaustion? We try to push through, thinking more effort will fix it. Social exhaustion? We go to more events, mistaking loneliness for social fatigue. Sensory exhaustion? We \u0026ldquo;relax\u0026rdquo; by staring at another screen. We assume a nap, a Netflix binge, or a “day off” will fix it.\nBut if you don’t know what kind of tired you are, you’ll never recover properly.\nSo Here’s How I’m Fixing It Instead of \u0026ldquo;resting\u0026rdquo; in a generic way, I’m resting with purpose.\nI match the type of rest to the type of exhaustion I’m feeling.\n1. Mental Exhaustion → Give Your Brain a Reset Deep work in short bursts – Focused sessions (like 25-minute Pomodoros) to reduce context-switching. Digital decluttering – Fewer tabs, fewer notifications, no mindless scrolling. Brain dump journaling – Writing down every stray thought to clear mental space. 2. Emotional Exhaustion → Reduce Decision Fatigue Fewer choices – I pre-plan meals, outfits, and small decisions so my brain doesn’t have to. Emotional boundaries – Saying ‘no’ more often and limiting draining interactions. Journaling – Processing emotions by writing them out instead of bottling them up. 3. Creative Exhaustion → Refuel Your Inspiration Consume good input – Reading, watching inspiring videos, experiencing new things. Change of scenery – Walking, visiting a new place, or simply switching rooms to reset my perspective. Play – Doing something fun and unrelated to work, like sketching or playing with my kids. 4. Social Exhaustion → Intentional Solitude Meaningful connections only – Prioritizing deep conversations over small talk. Scheduled alone time – Planning solo moments to recharge without interruptions. Boundaries – Limiting social commitments and giving myself permission to cancel. 5. Sensory Exhaustion → Turn Down the Noise Digital detox – No screens before bed. Phone on silent or Do Not Disturb mode. Minimalist workspace – Reducing visual clutter to minimize sensory overload. Silence and darkness – Spending time in quiet, dark environments to reset my senses. The Takeaway We’ve been tricked into thinking exhaustion is just about not sleeping enough.\nBut the real question isn’t \u0026ldquo;Am I tired?\u0026rdquo;—it’s \u0026ldquo;What kind of tired am I?\u0026rdquo;\nOnce you figure that out?\nYou can finally start recharging the right way.\nAnd you might just find that you’re not broken.\nYou were just resting wrong.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/why-youre-always-tired-not-just-about-sleep/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"why-youre-always-tired-and-its-not-just-about-sleep\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You’re Always Tired (And It’s Not Just About Sleep)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest time, I thought I was just \u003cem\u003etired.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot enough sleep, too much work, a 9-month-old who thinks 3 AM is party time.

It just feels that way.\nThe Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They edit, distort, and reshape them over time. And they’re really good at two things:\nBlurring the bad parts.\nWe naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments. The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel. It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions. Intensifying emotions.\nOur best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified. The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt magical. We remember how we felt, not necessarily how things were. This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, “They don’t make movies like they used to.”\nIt’s not that things were better. It’s that we experienced them differently.\nWhy We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us) So why do we keep looking back?\nBecause nostalgia is a safe place—one where we already know how everything turns out.\nAnd when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:\nThey make the past feel simpler, warmer, and more certain than it actually was.\nThink about it:\nThe ‘90s?\nWe remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls. Childhood?\nWe remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster. Early relationships?\nWe remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion. I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.\nBut I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.\nMy brain edited those parts out.\nThe Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.\nBut it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.\nWhen we convince ourselves that the past was better, we rob the present of its potential.\nWe start thinking:\n“Things will never be as good as they were.” “I was happier back then.” “The world is worse now.” But was it really better?\nOr did we just experience it differently?\nSo\u0026hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past? Not at all. Nostalgia is a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.\nHere’s how I see it now:\nInstead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.\nWhat made those times feel special? Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure? Maybe I need more of that in my life today. Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.\nEvery stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it. If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about creation and purpose. Instead of comparing, I create.\nThe past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today. The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again. The Takeaway Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a mirror—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.\nIt’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.\nIt came from how we experienced it.\nWe were present.

But none of them have ever been perfect.\nThere’s always something off.\n✔ Too big. Too small.\n✔ Too many pockets. Not enough pockets.\n✔ Feels great when empty. Turns into a brick when full.\nAnd yet, the search continues.\nThe Backpack Goldilocks Zone I know what I want—at least, in theory.\n✔ Compact but spacious – Big enough for a water bottle, light jacket, emergency battery, and some snacks. But not so big that I look like I’m about to hike the Appalachian Trail.\n✔ Lightweight but durable – Because I don’t want to feel like I’m carrying bricks, but I also don’t want it falling apart in six months.\n✔ Minimalist but functional – Clean design. No excessive straps, no giant logos, no 42 different compartments for things I’ll forget I even packed.\nSounds simple, right?\nYou’d think so.\nBut every time I think I’ve found “the one”, it ends up being\u0026hellip; not quite right.\nIt’s either too bulky when half-empty or too tight when fully loaded. It looks perfect online but feels terrible in real life. It’s either an endless black hole or a maze of tiny compartments that make me question my own memory. I’m not asking for a magic bag of holding.\nJust a backpack that actually fits my daily life.\nThe Backpacks That Have Let Me Down I’ve tried them all.\n1. The “Looks Perfect But Feels Terrible” Backpack I’ve been betrayed by backpacks that seem like the one, only to realize:\nThe straps dig into my shoulders like tiny instruments of torture. The padding looks comfortable, but after an hour of walking, my shoulders are on fire. Even the most \u0026ldquo;ergonomic\u0026rdquo; designs somehow turn into medieval punishment devices when I’m rushing through NYC. 2. The “Endless Black Hole” Backpack You know the kind. No organization, just one giant pocket where everything disappears.\nWant your keys? Hope you enjoy an archaeological dig.\nIt’s always the same scenario:\nI’m in a rush. The thing I need is somewhere at the bottom. I dig through tangled charging cables, crumpled receipts, and a water bottle that somehow went horizontal. By the time I find my keys, I’m questioning every decision that led me to this moment. 3. The “Too Many Compartments” Backpack At first, it seems genius. A special pocket for everything!\nThen, a month later, I can’t remember where anything is.\nIt’s a scavenger hunt every time I need my headphones.\nThere’s a pocket for my phone, a secret compartment for my wallet, a tiny slot for pens, and another one\u0026hellip; for\u0026hellip; what was that even for?\nThe more organized it tries to be, the more chaotic my life becomes.\n4. The “Why Is This So Heavy?!” Backpack Empty, it already feels like I’m carrying bricks.\nAdd a laptop and a water bottle, and suddenly I need physical therapy.\nI try to be a minimalist, but the backpack itself sabotages me.\nNow I check product descriptions for the empty weight before even considering a purchase.\nIf it feels heavy in the store, it’s already dead to me.\nWhy Do I Even Care This Much? I know this sounds ridiculous.\n\u0026ldquo;It’s just a backpack, right?\u0026rdquo;\nBut here’s the thing:\nA backpack is a daily companion.\nIt’s with you through:\nLong walks. Commutes. Unexpected errands. Last-minute snack storage emergencies. The right one makes life easier.\nThe wrong one? An endless source of frustration.\nAnd when you live in New York, where you’re constantly moving, your backpack is an extension of yourself.\nI’m walking miles every day.\nI’m squeezing into crowded subway cars.\nI’m weaving through tourist mobs in Times Square.\nI need a backpack that moves with me—not against me.\nI want to forget it’s even there, not curse its existence every time I try to get my MetroCard.\nThe Minimalist’s Dilemma I’m not just looking for a backpack.\nI’m looking for the one.\nThe last backpack I’ll ever need.\nI love minimalism.\nI’m on a mission to find:\n✔ One perfect item for every category in my life.\n✔ One pen. One jacket. One bag.\n✔ No backups. No alternatives. Just the best version of everything I use.\nSo when it comes to a backpack, it’s not just about functionality.\nIt’s about perfection.\nBecause if I find the right one, I’ll never have to think about backpacks again.\nBut that’s the problem, isn’t it?\nI keep thinking about backpacks.\nI keep testing, trying, and switching.\nBecause none of them have been “the one.”\nWill I Ever Find “The One”? I’d love to say I’ve finally found my perfect backpack, but let’s be real—this is an ongoing saga.\nMaybe the backpack is out there, waiting for me to discover it. Maybe it doesn’t exist, and I’ll just cycle through 20 more before giving up. Maybe, like some kind of minimalist curse, I’m doomed to be haunted by this search forever. Or maybe…\nJust maybe…\nThe real perfect backpack was the friends we made along the way.\n(But also, if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
