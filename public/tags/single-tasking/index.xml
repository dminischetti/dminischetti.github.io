      <description>Multitasking is a lie. Discover why single-tasking is the real productivity superpower and how it’s transforming my focus and life.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-multitasking-myth-why-doing-less-makes-you-more-productive"><strong>The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought I had <strong>cracked the code</strong> to getting things done.</p>
<p>I was a multitasker—<strong>a master of spinning plates.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Answering messages while debugging code.<br>
✔ Cooking dinner while listening to a tech podcast.<br>
✔ Planning my week while pushing a stroller.</p>
<p>I convinced myself this was <strong>peak efficiency</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="turns-out-i-was-dead-wrong"><strong>Turns out, I was dead wrong.</strong></h3>
<p>Multitasking isn’t a productivity hack. It’s <strong>a scam</strong>.</p>
<p>And worse? <strong>It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-hidden-cost-of-doing-it-all"><strong>The Hidden Cost of Doing It All</strong></h2>
<p>We live in a world that <strong>worships multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>🖥 Job descriptions praise it.<br>
📈 Productivity gurus preach it.<br>
📱 If you’re not multitasking, you’re “falling behind.”</p>
<p>But science—and <strong>my own experience</strong>—beg to differ.</p>
<p>Multitasking isn’t <strong>actually</strong> doing two things at once.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>rapid task-switching</strong>.</p>
<p>And every time you switch, your brain <strong>pays a price.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jumping between Slack messages and writing code?</strong> You’re not doubling your output—you’re introducing micro-delays that slow you down.</li>
<li><strong>Checking your phone while spending time with family?</strong> You’re mentally buffering between two worlds—never fully present in either.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to think multitasking kept me <strong>ahead</strong>.</p>
<p>But it was actually the <strong>thing keeping me stuck.</strong></p>
<p>I was <strong>always busy</strong> but never <em>truly</em> productive.</p>
<p>Then, I read something that <strong>hit me like a brick:</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-ability-to-single-task-is-becoming-a-superpower"><strong>“The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.”</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s when <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-heres-what-im-doing-instead"><strong>So Here’s What I’m Doing Instead</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve started embracing <strong>single-tasking</strong> like my productivity depends on it—<strong>because it does.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-time-blocking-20"><strong>1. Time-Blocking 2.0</strong></h3>
<p>I used to schedule my day <strong>down to the minute</strong>.</p>
<p>It only made me <strong>stressed</strong> when things didn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>Now, I align tasks with my <strong>actual energy levels</strong>:<br>
✔ <strong>High-focus work</strong> when my brain is sharp.<br>
✔ <strong>Low-focus tasks</strong> when I’m running on fumes.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>working with my brain, not against it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-digital-decluttering"><strong>2. Digital Decluttering</strong></h3>
<p>I used to think a million open tabs meant <strong>I was working hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>It just meant <strong>I was distracted</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I:<br>
✔ <strong>Close unused tabs.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Write down what I actually need.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Handle tasks <em>one at a time.</em></strong></p>
<p>If something’s <strong>important</strong>, it goes on my <strong>Notion board</strong>.<br>
If it’s not? <strong>It’s gone.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-one-tab-rule"><strong>3. The “One-Tab Rule”</strong></h3>
<p>If my brain <strong>wants a second tab</strong>, it means <strong>I need a second task slot later—not now.</strong></p>
<p>This was <strong>tough</strong> as a developer.</p>
<p>I’m used to juggling:<br>
✔ <strong>Documentation</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Stack Overflow threads</strong><br>
✔ <strong>My IDE</strong></p>
<p>But once I stopped, my <strong>focus got sharper.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-thinking-in-depth-not-breadth"><strong>4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of <strong>half-absorbing</strong> five articles, I <strong>read one properly</strong>—and actually retain something.</p>
<p>✔ No more <strong>fake productivity.</strong><br>
✔ No more <strong>information overload.</strong></p>
<p>The result?<br>
✔ <strong>Deeper focus.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Lower stress.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Better work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Actually being present in my own life.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve been sold the lie that <strong>multitasking is the key to success.</strong></p>
<p>But what if the real key is <strong>the opposite?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a world where we:<br>
✔ Stop bragging about <strong>being busy</strong>.<br>
✔ Start taking pride in <strong>how well we do one thing at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine how different life would feel.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not perfect at it yet.</p>
<p>I still catch myself <strong>falling back into old habits</strong>:<br>
✔ Checking messages while pushing code.<br>
✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.</p>
<p>But now, I <strong>notice it.</strong></p>
<p>I stop.<br>
I refocus.</p>
<p>I’m done with the <strong>chaos.</strong></p>
