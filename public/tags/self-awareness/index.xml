      <description>Changing your mind isn’t a weakness—it’s growth. Discover why evolving your perspective makes you smarter and more adaptable.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people think <strong>changing your mind is a weakness</strong>—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That <strong>certainty equals strength</strong> and doubt makes you unreliable.</p>
<p>I <strong>completely disagree.</strong></p>
<p>I change my mind <strong>all the time.</strong> Not because I’m indecisive, but because <strong>I’m learning.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-art-of-arguing-with-yourself"><strong>The Art of Arguing With Yourself</strong></h2>
<p>It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, <strong>your brain worked hard to form it.</strong></p>
<p>And then, suddenly&hellip; doubt creeps in.</p>
<p>You start thinking about the <strong>opposite perspective.</strong> You challenge your own logic. You realize, <em>maybe I was missing something.</em></p>
<p>Some people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: <strong>every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve realized that my opinions are just <strong>snapshots</strong> of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need <strong>updates.</strong></p>
<p>I constantly ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What if I’m wrong?</em></li>
<li><em>What am I not considering?</em></li>
<li><em>How would someone who disagrees with me see this?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I argue <strong>against my own beliefs</strong> to test their strength. I look for <strong>holes in my logic.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t being indecisive. <strong>This is debugging my own thinking.</strong></p>
<p>And every time I find a flaw, I fix it. <strong>I upgrade.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="marriage-the-ultimate-debate-club"><strong>Marriage: The Ultimate Debate Club</strong></h2>
<p>If you want practice in <strong>changing your mind</strong>, get married.</p>
<p>My wife and I <strong>love</strong> to debate. Not argue—debate.</p>
<p>It starts with small things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is this really the best way to load the dishwasher?</em></li>
<li><em>Is a hot dog a sandwich?</em></li>
<li><em>Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, two hours later, we’re deep into <strong>life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.</strong></p>
<p>And sometimes, <strong>we completely switch sides.</strong></p>
<p>Not because one of us &ldquo;won.&rdquo;<br>
Not because we’re trying to be &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But because we actually <strong>listened</strong> to each other.</p>
<p>Because <strong>seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.</strong></p>
<p>And yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.<br>
(Okay, <strong>often</strong> she’s right, but that’s another story.)</p>
<p>But every time I admit I was wrong, <strong>I get smarter.</strong><br>
And every time she does, <strong>we both grow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-changing-your-mind-is-a-superpower"><strong>Why Changing Your Mind is a Superpower</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you never change your mind, <strong>you’re not learning.</strong> You’re just repeating yourself.</li>
<li>Admitting you were wrong <strong>doesn’t make you weak.</strong> It makes you someone people actually trust.</li>
<li>The smartest people <strong>aren’t the ones who refuse to budge.</strong> They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<p>Every time you change your mind, it means <strong>you’ve learned something new.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science evolves</strong> by questioning and updating its ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Great leaders</strong> adjust their strategies when new information comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Successful people</strong> don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing your mind <strong>doesn’t mean you were stupid before.</strong><br>
It means you’re <strong>smarter now.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t mean you were wrong.<br>
It means <strong>you’ve improved.</strong></p>
<p>And over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles <strong>the truth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="version-20-and-beyond"><strong>Version 2.0 (And Beyond)</strong></h2>
<p>I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.<br>
Now, I see it as <strong>a sign of growth.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to be <strong>version 1.0 of myself forever.</strong><br>
I want to be <strong>2.0, 3.0, 10.0</strong>—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.</p>
<p>Some people are <strong>proud of being &ldquo;consistent.&rdquo;</strong> But if you’re consistent <strong>just for the sake of consistency</strong>, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.</p>
<p>People who never change their minds? <strong>They’re frozen in time.</strong><br>
People who adapt, question, and rethink? <strong>They’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>And that means being willing to say,<br>
<em>&ldquo;I was wrong.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I learned something new.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It means embracing <strong>doubt, curiosity, and growth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>People think strength is about <strong>sticking to your guns no matter what.</strong><br>
But real strength? <strong>Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being <strong>curious</strong> enough to question yourself.</li>
<li>Being <strong>humble</strong> enough to admit when you’re wrong.</li>
<li>Being <strong>smart</strong> enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next time someone accuses you of <strong>flip-flopping</strong>, don’t take it as an insult.<br>
Take it as <strong>proof that you’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>Because the strongest minds?<br>
They’re the ones that <strong>never stop upgrading.</strong></p>

      <title>Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)</title>

      <description>We often think the past was better, but nostalgia tricks us. Discover why we romanticize the past and how to appreciate the present.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck"><strong>Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)</strong></h1>
<p>Ever caught yourself thinking, <em>“Things were better back then”</em>?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just <em>felt</em> different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.</p>
<p>I do this all the time.</p>
<p>I think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.<br>
I remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being <em>disconnected.</em></p>
<p>And then, reality hits me: <strong>the past wasn’t actually better. It just feels that way.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-nostalgia-filter-why-we-rewrite-our-own-history"><strong>The Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History</strong></h2>
<p>Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They <strong>edit, distort, and reshape</strong> them over time. And they’re <em>really</em> good at two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Blurring the bad parts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments.</li>
<li>The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel.</li>
<li>It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intensifying emotions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified.</li>
<li>The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt <em>magical.</em></li>
<li>We remember how we <em>felt</em>, not necessarily how things <em>were.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, <em>“They don’t make movies like they used to.”</em></p>
<p>It’s not that things were better. <strong>It’s that we experienced them differently.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-we-crave-the-past-and-how-it-tricks-us"><strong>Why We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us)</strong></h2>
<p>So why do we keep looking back?</p>
<p>Because nostalgia is <strong>a safe place</strong>—one where we already know how everything turns out.</p>
<p>And when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:</p>
<p>They make the past feel <strong>simpler, warmer, and more certain</strong> than it actually was.</p>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ‘90s?</strong><br>
We remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls.</li>
<li><strong>Childhood?</strong><br>
We remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster.</li>
<li><strong>Early relationships?</strong><br>
We remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.<br>
But I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.</p>
<p>My brain <strong>edited those parts out.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-double-edged-sword-of-nostalgia"><strong>The Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia</strong></h2>
<p>Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be <strong>beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.</strong><br>
But it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.</p>
<p>When we convince ourselves that the past was better, we <strong>rob the present of its potential.</strong></p>
<p>We start thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Things will never be as good as they were.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I was happier back then.”</em></li>
<li><em>“The world is worse now.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But was it really better?<br>
Or did we just experience it <strong>differently</strong>?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so"><strong>So&hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past?</strong></h2>
<p>Not at all. Nostalgia is <strong>a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I see it now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What made those times feel special?</li>
<li>Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure?</li>
<li>Maybe I need <em>more</em> of that in my life today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it.</li>
<li>If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about <strong>creation and purpose.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of comparing, I create.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today.</li>
<li>The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a <strong>mirror</strong>—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.</p>
<p>It’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.<br>
It came from <strong>how we experienced it.</strong></p>
<p>We were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.</p>
<p>So next time you find yourself saying, <em>“Things were better back then”</em>, stop and ask:</p>
<p><em>Or maybe&hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?</em></p>
<p>Maybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how <strong>distracted, rushed, and stressed</strong> we’ve become.</p>
<p>Maybe the best days aren’t behind us.<br>
<strong>Maybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.</strong></p>
