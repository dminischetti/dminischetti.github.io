      <description>Growing a beard was never in my plans. But this accidental experiment taught me more about identity than I expected.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been a <strong>beard guy.</strong></p>
<p>For most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just <strong>happened</strong> to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age. I’d see guys with <strong>thick, full beards</strong> and think, <em>Yeah, that’s just not for me.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I shave because I always have.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>I’m just not a beard person.</strong></p>
<p>And then, one day&hellip; <strong>I didn’t shave.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-accidental-beard-experiment"><strong>The Accidental Beard Experiment</strong></h2>
<p>I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, <em>I shall grow a beard!</em></p>
<p>It started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had <strong>more stubble than usual.</strong></p>
<p>Normally, this would have <strong>annoyed me.</strong> But this time?</p>
<p>I let it stay.</p>
<p>At first, it felt weird—like my <strong>own face was betraying me.</strong> I&rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, <em>Who is this guy?</em></p>
<p>The <strong>itchy phase</strong> was real.<br>
The <strong>awkward patchy phase</strong> was even more real.</p>
<p>But the strangest part?</p>
<p>I <strong>kind of liked it.</strong></p>
<p>I started noticing little things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It made me <strong>look older</strong> (or maybe just <em>different</em>).</li>
<li>It <strong>changed the shape of my face.</strong></li>
<li>I kept catching myself <strong>stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a <strong>reminder</strong> that something was changing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-growing-a-beard-felt-so-different"><strong>Why Growing a Beard Felt So… Different</strong></h2>
<p>It’s funny how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can change the way you see yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I looked different.</strong> My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a <strong>real-life Instagram filter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I felt different.</strong> There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more <strong>deliberate.</strong> Like I had <em>made a choice</em>, even if that choice was just to&hellip; not shave.</li>
<li><strong>Other people noticed.</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;You look… more Italian now.&rdquo;</em> (<em>That one made me laugh.</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn’t prepared for how much <strong>other people</strong> would comment on it. It was like I had <strong>changed something huge</strong>, when all I did was&hellip; <em>nothing.</em></p>
<p>And every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of <strong>pride and discomfort.</strong> Like I was being <strong>seen in a new way</strong>—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-letting-my-face-do-its-thing"><strong>What I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing</strong></h2>
<p>Growing a beard <strong>didn’t change my life.</strong></p>
<p>But it did make me <strong>realize something important.</strong></p>
<p>So many of the things we believe about ourselves—our <strong>“defaults”</strong>—aren’t actually rules. They’re just <strong>habits.</strong></p>
<p>For years, I thought:<br>
✔ <em>I’m a clean-shaven guy.</em><br>
✔ <em>Beards don’t suit me.</em><br>
✔ <em>This is just how I look.</em></p>
<p>And then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” <strong>disappeared.</strong></p>
<p>It made me wonder:<br>
<em>How many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I’m not a morning person.</strong> (<em>Or am I just used to staying up late?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I don’t like public speaking.</strong> (<em>Or have I just never given it a real chance?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I’m not a beard guy.</strong> (<em>Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s strange how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can make you question so much more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="will-i-keep-it"><strong>Will I Keep It?</strong></h2>
<p>I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll <strong>shave it off next week.</strong><br>
Maybe I’ll <strong>keep it longer.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m just <strong>letting it be.</strong></p>
<p>No expectations. No rules. Just <strong>curiosity.</strong></p>
<p>But either way, this isn’t really about the beard.</p>
<p>It’s about realizing that sometimes, <strong>the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>That’s worth exploring.</strong></p>

      <title>Why We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)</title>

      <description>Change isn&amp;#39;t about willpower—it&amp;#39;s about identity. Discover why habits fail and how shifting your identity leads to lasting change.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works"><strong>Why We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)</strong></h1>
<p>I used to think change was about willpower.</p>
<p>If I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder. Push through resistance. Be disciplined.</p>
<p>I told myself, <em>“Just do it. No excuses.”</em></p>
<p>And for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.</p>
<p>But then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.</p>
<p>And every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.</p>
<p>Then I learned something that changed everything:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why"><strong>Why &ldquo;Trying Harder&rdquo; Never Works</strong></h2>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<p>Two people are offered a cigarette.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first person says, <em>“No thanks, I’m trying to quit.”</em></li>
<li>The second person says, <em>“No thanks, I don’t smoke.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first person is using willpower—constantly resisting.</li>
<li>The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why most habits fail.</p>
<p>We focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-identity-based-approach-to-change"><strong>The Identity-Based Approach to Change</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.</p>
<p>Every action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person.</li>
<li>If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer.</li>
<li>If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to stop seeing habits as things I <em>do</em> and start seeing them as things that define who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-im-rewiring-my-brain-for-lasting-change"><strong>How I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change</strong></h2>
<p>I started with small identity shifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of <em>“I should exercise more,”</em> I tell myself <em>“I’m the kind of person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to focus better,”</em> I remind myself <em>“I’m someone who works with deep focus.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to stop procrastinating,”</em> I say <em>“I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:</p>
<p><strong>The brain hates cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>
<p>When you tell yourself you <em>are</em> something, you subconsciously start acting like it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day.</li>
<li>If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes.</li>
<li>If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-trying-and-being"><strong>The Difference Between Trying and Being</strong></h2>
<p>I used to say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m trying to exercise more.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to focus better.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to wake up earlier.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now I say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m a person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m someone who works with focus.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m the kind of person who gets up early.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.</p>
<p>And identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Willpower is unreliable.<br>
Motivation fades.<br>
But identity sticks.</p>
<p>If you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.<br>
Start with who you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to read more? Become a reader.</li>
<li>Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health.</li>
<li>Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the truth is:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.</strong></p>
<p>Change who you are, and the actions will follow.</p>
