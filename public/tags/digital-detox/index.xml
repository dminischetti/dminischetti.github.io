      <description>Social media was supposed to keep me connected with friends. Instead, it&amp;#39;s just ads, strangers, and reminders of things I can&amp;#39;t have anymore.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a time when <strong>Facebook and Instagram felt like a lifeline</strong>—a way to stay connected with friends, share life’s moments, and keep some kind of bridge between us.</p>
<p>Then, at some point, <strong>Mark Zuckerberg decided my nostalgia needed to be monetized.</strong></p>
<p>These days, my Facebook feed looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li>Friend at the beach in Puglia (ouch, thanks for reminding me)</li>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li>Friend eating fresh mozzarella (okay, now you’re just hurting my feelings)</li>
<li><strong>Ad</strong></li>
<li>Random guy trying to sell me crypto</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, I’m in New York, staring at a so-called &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; mozzarella ball that has the <strong>texture of a wet sponge.</strong></p>
<p>At some point, I had to ask myself: <strong>Why am I still here?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-slow-goodbye"><strong>The Slow Goodbye</strong></h2>
<p>Leaving wasn’t a sudden decision. There was no dramatic <em>“That’s it, I’M DONE!”</em> moment.</p>
<p>At first, I just <strong>posted less</strong>. Then I stopped checking notifications. Eventually, my accounts became <strong>digital storage units</strong>—just a place where old photos sat collecting virtual dust.</p>
<p>And the strangest part?</p>
<p><strong>No one even noticed.</strong></p>
<p>The people who actually matter? <strong>They already have my number.</strong> They text, call, or WhatsApp me. They don’t need to <strong>&ldquo;like&rdquo; a photo</strong> to know I care about them.</p>
<p>So again&hellip; <strong>why am I still here?</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="social-media-isnt-about-friends-anymore"><strong>Social Media Isn’t About Friends Anymore</strong></h2>
<p>Remember when social media was about <em>your</em> friends? Now it’s just:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel San</strong>, telling me <strong>&ldquo;Things I didn’t know before 30.&rdquo;</strong> (<em>Listen, Daniel, I’m 46. At this point, I’m forgetting things I knew at 30. It’s called aging.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Khaby Lame</strong>, silently mocking viral idiots who complicate basic tasks. (<em>Okay, I admit, Khaby&rsquo;s funny. But how many potato-peeling hacks do we really need?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Jay Shetty</strong>, soothingly explaining how <strong>deadlines don’t matter—inner peace does.</strong> (<em>Jay, tell that to my landlord next month.</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, my actual friends? <strong>Their posts are buried under 15 ads for things Alexa overheard me casually mention.</strong></p>
<p>And when I <em>do</em> finally see them? It’s just another picture of them at a seaside restaurant eating fresh pasta, while I’m here in New York with a <strong>manicotti dish that tastes like cardboard sadness.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-im-logging-outfor-good"><strong>So, I’m Logging Out—For Good</strong></h2>
<p>It’s time to say <strong>basta.</strong> I’m not just <em>taking a break</em>—I’m <strong>deleting my accounts completely.</strong></p>
<p>But don’t worry, I’m not disappearing into thin air (though some days, I wouldn’t mind).</p>
<p>If you actually want to stay in touch, you already know how to reach me:</p>
<p>📞 <strong>Call me.</strong> Yes, phones still work for talking.<br>
💬 <strong>Text or WhatsApp me.</strong> I might take a while to reply, but I always do.<br>
✉️ <strong>Email me.</strong> I’m old enough to still like emails.</p>
<p>Basically, if we’re real friends, <strong>you already know where to find me.</strong></p>
<p>And if you don’t?</p>
<p>Maybe we were just <strong>social media acquaintances.</strong> And that’s okay too.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="no-dramatic-goodbyejust-moving-on"><strong>No Dramatic Goodbye—Just Moving On</strong></h2>
<p>So, that’s it. No emotional farewell, no deep soul-searching journey.</p>
<p>Just <strong>logging out and moving on.</strong></p>
<p>See you on the other side. 😊</p>
