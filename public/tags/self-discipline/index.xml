      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck"><strong>The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I waited for <strong>motivation to strike</strong>.</p>
<p>I thought <strong>productive people</strong> had some kind of <strong>magical drive</strong> I didn’t.<br>
That one day, I’d wake up <strong>full of energy</strong>, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects <strong>without procrastinating</strong>.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>That day <strong>never came.</strong></p>
<p>And it never <em>will.</em></p>
<p>Because here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-lie"><strong>Motivation is a lie.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-motivation-doesnt-matter"><strong>Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve all said it:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I just need to get motivated.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ll start when I feel ready.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I don’t have the energy today.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But <strong>motivation isn’t something you <em>have</em>—it’s something you <em>create.</em></strong></p>
<p>We think <strong>action comes after motivation</strong>, when really, it’s the other way around.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-follows-action-not-the-other-way-around"><strong>Motivation follows action, not the other way around.</strong></h3>
<p>You don’t <strong>wait to feel inspired</strong> before starting.<br>
You start, and then <strong>inspiration finds you.</strong></p>
<p>Once I figured this out, <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<p>I used to wait for that <strong>perfect wave of motivation</strong>—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something:</p>
<h3 id="i-always-felt-more-motivated-after-i-started-not-before"><strong>I always felt more motivated after I started, not before.</strong></h3>
<p>Even if I <em>didn’t feel like it</em>—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.<br>
That’s when I realized:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-side-effect-of-action"><strong>Motivation is a side effect of action.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-actually-works-and-why-its-so-simple"><strong>What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple)</strong></h2>
<p>If I waited to <em>feel</em> motivated, I’d never do anything.</p>
<p>So instead, I follow <strong>three simple rules</strong> that make action inevitable:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-the-5-minute-rule"><strong>1. The 5-Minute Rule</strong></h3>
<p>If something feels overwhelming, I <strong>trick my brain</strong> by saying:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I’ll just do it for five minutes.</strong> That’s it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too tired to work out?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of exercise.</em></li>
<li><strong>Don’t want to start that project?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of brainstorming.</em></li>
<li><strong>Can’t focus on writing?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of bad first drafts.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>90% of the time, I keep going.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>starting is the hardest part.</strong> Once I’m in motion, <strong>momentum keeps me moving.</strong></p>
<p>And if I really <strong>do stop after five minutes?</strong><br>
At least I did <em>something</em>—and something is infinitely <strong>better than nothing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-no-emotion-rule"><strong>2. The “No Emotion” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>I stopped asking myself <strong>if I <em>felt</em> like doing something.</strong></p>
<p>Feelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d <strong>never get anything done.</strong></p>
<p>So I stopped negotiating with myself.</p>
<p>Now, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. <strong>No debates. No negotiations.</strong><br>
It’s just <strong>what I do.</strong></p>
<p>✔ <strong>Exercise?</strong> → <em>It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Writing?</strong> → <em>Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Starting work?</strong> → <em>Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Action first. Feelings later.</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly, <strong>once I start, motivation usually shows up.</strong></p>
<p>And if it doesn’t? <strong>Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-3-choice-trick"><strong>3. The 3-Choice Trick</strong></h3>
<p>When I don’t want to do something, I <strong>limit my options</strong> to just three:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>Do it now.</strong> (<em>Just start, even if it’s imperfect.</em>)<br>
2️⃣ <strong>Do it badly.</strong> (<em>Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.</em>)<br>
3️⃣ <strong>Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.</strong></p>
<p>Turns out, <strong>staring at a wall is boring.</strong> So I usually just do the thing.</p>
<p>This trick works because it eliminates <strong>all distractions</strong>.<br>
I’m not allowed to <strong>scroll on my phone</strong> or <strong>check social media</strong>.</p>
<p>My only choices?<br>
✔ <strong>Work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Do it badly.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-works-the-science-of-momentum"><strong>Why This Works: The Science of Momentum</strong></h2>
<p>Newton’s First Law of Motion states:</p>
<h3 id="an-object-at-rest-stays-at-rest-and-an-object-in-motion-stays-in-motion"><strong>“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.”</strong></h3>
<p>Turns out, <strong>this applies to humans too.</strong></p>
<p>When we’re at rest (<strong>not doing the thing</strong>), it feels <strong>impossible to get moving</strong>.<br>
But <strong>once we start</strong>, it’s <strong>easier to keep going.</strong></p>
<p>This is why the hardest part of any task is <strong>getting started.</strong><br>
It’s why the <strong>5-minute rule works so well</strong>.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>It breaks the inertia.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It removes overthinking.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It makes starting feel effortless.</strong></p>
<p>And once you’re moving? <strong>Momentum takes over.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about willpower.<br>
It’s about <strong>tricking your brain into motion.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-trap-its-not-coming-to-save-you"><strong>Motivation is a trap.</strong> It’s not coming to save you.</h3>
<p>If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.<br>
If you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.</p>
<p>But action? <strong>Action leads to momentum.</strong><br>
And <strong>momentum creates motivation.</strong></p>
<p>So next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Start for five minutes.</strong> (<em>Even if it’s terrible.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Do it without debating.</strong> (<em>Feelings can catch up later.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Give yourself only three choices.</strong> (<em>Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.</em>)</p>
<p>Because once you start, you <em>won’t</em> stop.</p>
<p>And when you stop needing motivation to begin, <strong>you’ll get more done than ever before.</strong></p>
