      <description>Struggling to keep track of your ideas and tasks? Discover why Notion is the external brain I never knew I needed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of my life, I’ve been at war with <strong>my own memory</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m great at solving problems, debugging complex code, and figuring out tricky logic flows. But ask me where I saved that important note from last week? <strong>Gone.</strong> Ask me what I was about to do five seconds ago? <strong>No idea.</strong></p>
<p>My brain has this incredible ability to cling to <strong>completely useless information</strong> while ruthlessly discarding the things I actually need.</p>
<p>I’ve spent <strong>years</strong> searching for a way to keep my thoughts, projects, and tasks organized. I tried:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Sticky notes</strong> (<em>good luck finding them when I actually need them&hellip; they vanish into another dimension</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>To-do list apps</strong> (<em>too rigid, too limited, abandoned after a week</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>Google Docs</strong> (<em>a black hole where ideas go to die</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>My own memory</strong> (<em>don’t even ask</em>).</p>
<p>Nothing worked.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled upon <strong>Notion</strong>, and suddenly, <strong>my brain had a backup system.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-notion-works-for-me-when-everything-else-failed"><strong>Why Notion Works for Me (When Everything Else Failed)</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve always been skeptical of <strong>“all-in-one” productivity tools</strong>.</p>
<p>Every app promises to be <strong>the last one you’ll ever need</strong>—and every single time, I end up uninstalling it because it’s either <strong>too simple, too complicated, or just doesn’t fit how I think</strong>.</p>
<p>Notion is the first one that actually <strong>adapts to me</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s a notes app, task manager, and database—all at once.</strong> But only if I want it to be. I can keep it simple or build a full-blown project tracker. It’s a <strong>blank canvas</strong>, and I decide the rules.</li>
<li><strong>The free version is actually good.</strong> Unlike Obsidian, I don’t have to pay just to sync across devices. Unlike Evernote, I don’t feel like I’m using <strong>a relic from 2010</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>I can publish and share pages instantly.</strong> No fighting with exporting or formatting—one click, and it’s a webpage. Done.</li>
<li><strong>I can dump everything into it, and nothing gets lost.</strong> Ideas, tasks, half-baked thoughts—<strong>they all have a home now.</strong> And somehow, I can actually <strong>find them when I need them</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before Notion, my workflow was <strong>a mess</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes buried in <strong>random text files</strong>.</li>
<li>Ideas scattered in <strong>Google Keep</strong>, which I’d forget existed.</li>
<li>Tasks floating in my head, <strong>patiently waiting to be forgotten</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now? <strong>Everything is in one place.</strong> Exactly where I expect it to be.</p>
<p>It’s like having my own <strong>personal knowledge base</strong>, and for the first time, I actually <strong>trust my system</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-about-the-offline-mode"><strong>What About the Offline Mode?</strong></h2>
<p>Yeah, I know—<strong>Notion doesn’t work offline.</strong></p>
<p>For most people, that’s a deal-breaker. But for me? <strong>It doesn’t matter.</strong></p>
<p>I work <strong>online all the time</strong>. My job as a developer is remote. My files live in the cloud. My meetings are on video calls.</p>
<p>The only time I’d need offline notes is if I were <strong>stuck in a cabin with no internet</strong>—and at that point, I have <strong>bigger problems than note-taking.</strong></p>
<p>Like figuring out <strong>how to survive without Stack Overflow.</strong></p>
<p>For my actual, <strong>daily reality</strong>, Notion’s <strong>always-online</strong> approach isn’t a limitation.<br>
<strong>It’s just how I already work.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>I didn’t think I needed Notion.</p>
<p>I thought I just needed to <strong>be more disciplined</strong> or find the “right” system to organize my thoughts. I assumed <strong>I was just bad at remembering things</strong>, and that was that.</p>
<p>But now? <strong>I can’t imagine functioning without it.</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt like your thoughts are <strong>scattered across a dozen places</strong>, if you struggle to <strong>remember things you actually need</strong>, if you’ve tried <strong>every productivity tool and nothing stuck</strong>—</p>
<p><strong>Notion might be exactly what your brain has been waiting for.</strong></p>
<p>And unlike my real brain, <strong>it actually remembers things.</strong></p>

      <title>The Never-Ending Search for the Perfect App: Why I Can’t Stop Downloading</title>

      <description>Obsessed with finding the perfect app? You’re not alone. Join me on my endless quest for the ultimate productivity tools.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people spend their free time <strong>watching movies, playing games, or reading books</strong>.<br>
I spend mine on an endless, slightly obsessive search for <strong>the perfect app.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what it is—<strong>file manager, calendar, task manager, note-taking app</strong>—if I use it daily, I want it to be <em>just right</em>.</p>
<p>But here’s the problem: <strong>it never is.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-app-store-illusion"><strong>The App Store Illusion</strong></h2>
<p>It always starts the same way.</p>
<p>I convince myself that somewhere, hidden among a sea of <strong>mediocre software</strong>, <strong>the perfect app exists</strong>.</p>
<p>So I start searching.<br>
Reading reviews.<br>
Watching <strong>YouTube comparisons at 2x speed</strong>.<br>
Checking <strong>Reddit threads full of people just like me</strong>—people who have fallen down the same rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I get lost in endless lists like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Top 10 Productivity Apps You Need.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Best File Managers for Windows and iPhone.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, I find something <strong>promising</strong>.</p>
<p>I download it, open it, start setting it up… and then the realization hits:</p>
<p><strong>Something is off.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The interface is <em>almost</em> perfect, but there’s <strong>one weird design choice</strong> that drives me insane.</li>
<li>The features are great, but <strong>why is there a subscription for this?</strong></li>
<li>It’s perfect on <strong>iPhone</strong>, but the <strong>Windows version looks like it was built in 2009</strong> and abandoned.</li>
<li>It’s perfect on <strong>Windows</strong>, but the <strong>iPhone version syncs once every full moon</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just like that, <strong>the cycle continues</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-do-i-do-this-to-myself"><strong>Why Do I Do This to Myself?</strong></h2>
<p>I know what you’re thinking:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Why not just pick one and move on?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Because that’s what <strong>normal people</strong> do. But my brain <strong>doesn’t work that way</strong>.</p>
<p>I need <strong>flow</strong> in my tools. If I open an app and something feels <strong>even slightly frustrating</strong>, it’s like an <strong>itch I can’t scratch</strong>.<br>
I’ll notice it <strong>every time</strong> I use it. And once I notice it? I <strong>can’t un-notice it</strong>.</p>
<p>I have a <strong>zero-tolerance policy</strong> for inefficiency:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>If an app takes more than two clicks</strong> to do something that should take one, it’s dead to me.<br>
✔ <strong>If it’s ugly</strong> or the design is inconsistent, I won’t use it, <strong>no matter how powerful it is</strong>.<br>
✔ <strong>If it’s perfect but has a monthly subscription,</strong> I will uninstall it <strong>on principle</strong>.</p>
<p>I want my apps to feel <strong>invisible</strong>, like they don’t exist. They should <strong>just work</strong> without reminding me they’re there.</p>
<p>The worst part?</p>
<p>The apps I abandoned <strong>months ago</strong>?<br>
Sometimes, I <strong>go back</strong>, thinking,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Maybe they fixed it. Maybe it wasn’t so bad.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It was.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-windows-vs-iphone-struggle"><strong>The Windows vs. iPhone Struggle</strong></h2>
<p>If you’re an Apple user, you know that <strong>Apple apps just work together</strong>.<br>
But try finding an app that <strong>works flawlessly on both Windows and iPhone?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good luck.</strong></p>
<p>I live in <strong>two worlds</strong>:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Windows for work.</strong> It’s where I <strong>code, debug, and spend most of my day</strong>.<br>
✔ <strong>iPhone for personal life.</strong> It’s where I <strong>organize tasks, take notes, and communicate</strong>.</p>
<p>You’d think by now, in 2024, we’d have <strong>seamless cross-platform apps that work beautifully everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone apps</strong> are <strong>beautiful</strong>, but their <strong>Windows counterparts</strong> feel like <strong>afterthoughts</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Windows apps</strong> are <strong>powerful</strong>, but most of them were <strong>designed by people who hate UI</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The “cross-platform” apps?</strong> Usually the <strong>worst of both worlds</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought switching to <strong>Android</strong> would solve this.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>It just gave me <strong>different</strong> problems.</p>
<p>I’ve even considered switching <strong>everything to Apple</strong>, but the thought of using <strong>macOS for development</strong> makes me break out in <strong>hives</strong>.<br>
I like my <strong>hardware customizable</strong> and my <strong>software open</strong>, thank you very much.</p>
<p>So I keep searching, hoping that <strong>one day, the perfect ecosystem will exist</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-inevitable-conclusion"><strong>The Inevitable Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, I’ve <strong>accepted my fate</strong>.</p>
<p>I will <strong>never</strong> settle.</p>
<p>I will always <strong>tweak, test, uninstall, reinstall, and repeat</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will keep <strong>switching between One Commander and Total Commander</strong> because <strong>each is 90% perfect but missing one crucial feature</strong>.</li>
<li>I will keep <strong>trying every new calendar app</strong> that promises to <strong>revolutionize scheduling</strong>, only to <strong>go back to Google Calendar</strong>.</li>
<li>I will keep hoping that <strong>one day, Fantastical will magically become cross-platform</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe <strong>there is no perfect app</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem <strong>isn’t the apps—it’s me</strong>.</p>
<p>But until someone creates a:<br>
✔ <strong>Seamless</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Beautiful</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Feature-packed</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Cross-platform</strong><br>
✔ <strong>One-time-payment</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Ad-free</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Non-subscription</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Perfectly intuitive app for every function I need</strong>…</p>
<p>I’ll be here.<br>
<strong>Searching. Comparing. Complaining.</strong></p>
<p>And then <strong>downloading another one</strong>.</p>

      <title>The Browser Wars: My Exhausting Journey to Finding the Least Annoying Setup</title>

      <description>Choosing a browser shouldn&amp;#39;t be this hard. From Safari’s WebKit prison to Windows’ Chromium clones, here’s my exhausting browser journey.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a software developer. I build things for the web. I write code.<br>
I understand how browsers work.</p>
<p>And yet, somehow, <strong>choosing a default browser nearly broke me.</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t supposed to be this complicated. <strong>It’s just a browser.</strong><br>
A glorified <strong>tab holder</strong>. A tool to open Stack Overflow, forget why I opened it, and then open another tab instead.</p>
<p>But the moment I tried to pick <em>the one</em>—<strong>the browser that would rule them all</strong>—I descended into <strong>a personal crisis so deep I started questioning reality itself.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="round-1-the-iphone-problem-or-apples-webkit-prison"><strong>Round 1: The iPhone Problem (Or: Apple’s WebKit Prison)</strong></h2>
<p>I thought I had a choice.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>I believed I could just <strong>install Chrome or Firefox on my iPhone</strong> and live a normal life.</p>
<p>What a fool I was.</p>
<p>Because Apple, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t actually let you <strong>use</strong> a real browser on iOS.<br>
No matter what I install—<strong>Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Opera, or a browser hand-coded by an underground group of free software rebels</strong>—they’re <strong>all WebKit underneath.</strong></p>
<p>Which means every browser on iPhone is just <strong>Safari wearing a cheap disguise.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chrome?</strong> Safari with Google Sync.</li>
<li><strong>Firefox?</strong> Safari with different branding.</li>
<li><strong>Brave?</strong> Safari with a tinfoil hat.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no escape. Safari is the law.</p>
<p>I tried resisting. I tried using Chrome on my iPhone, <strong>convincing myself it was different.</strong><br>
It wasn’t.</p>
<p>The pages loaded the same. The bugs were the same.<br>
The only difference? <strong>A Google logo and more tracking.</strong></p>
<p>At some point, I accepted my fate. <strong>If everything is WebKit, I might as well use the original.</strong></p>
<p>Fine. <strong>Safari wins on iPhone.</strong><br>
Not because I love it, but because Apple made sure that fighting it would be a <strong>slow, battery-draining death.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="round-2-the-windows-browser-crisis-or-where-every-browser-is-the-same-anyway"><strong>Round 2: The Windows Browser Crisis (Or: Where Every Browser is the Same Anyway)</strong></h2>
<p>On Windows, the situation should be better. No WebKit dictatorship. No artificial restrictions. <strong>Freedom.</strong></p>
<p>Or so I thought.</p>
<p>In reality, <strong>every Windows browser is just Chromium with different personality issues.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chrome</strong> – The original Chromium overlord. <strong>Fast, powerful, but eats RAM like it’s a competitive sport</strong> and makes you sign into a Google account just to exist.</li>
<li><strong>Brave</strong> – Chrome, but constantly reminding you that it’s better than Chrome. <strong>Also, why does it keep asking me about crypto?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vivaldi</strong> – For people who think <strong>customizing a browser is a personality trait.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Opera</strong> – Who even uses Opera? Who are you people? <strong>Reveal yourselves.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Firefox</strong> – The only non-Chromium option, so I wanted to love it. <strong>But somehow, it makes every website feel slightly off</strong>, and the font rendering gives me trust issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, I realized something horrifying.</p>
<p><strong>Every time I tried a new browser, I ended up back in Chrome’s arms.</strong></p>
<p>Not because I <em>wanted</em> to, but because <strong>the entire web is optimized for Chromium.</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to love Firefox. I even tried convincing myself that <strong>the slightly-off fonts were a feature.</strong><br>
But in the end, it just made me feel like I was in an <strong>alternate universe where everything was almost right… but not quite.</strong></p>
<p>So, I gave up. If I had to use Chromium, I might as well use <strong>the version that’s optimized for Windows</strong> and doesn’t aggressively push Google services on me.</p>
<p>And that’s how <strong>Edge won by default.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="round-3-the-syncing-nightmare-or-how-i-glued-this-mess-together"><strong>Round 3: The Syncing Nightmare (Or: How I Glued This Mess Together)</strong></h2>
<p>So now I had:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safari on iPhone</strong> (<em>because Apple won’t let me have nice things</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Edge on Windows</strong> (<em>because all Chromium browsers are the same, and Edge just integrates better</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>But now came the <strong>real</strong> problem.</p>
<p><strong>How do I sync bookmarks between two browsers that don’t want to talk to each other?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google wants me to <strong>use Chrome on everything</strong> like some kind of cross-platform cult.</li>
<li>Apple wants me to <strong>use Safari on everything</strong> because I made the mistake of owning an iPhone.</li>
<li>Microsoft wants me to <strong>embrace Edge fully</strong> and probably switch to Bing while I’m at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I refused to let any of them win.</p>
<p>So I <strong>hacked my way out</strong> with <strong>iCloud Bookmarks Extension for Edge.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now <strong>Safari and Edge share bookmarks</strong> like two kids forced to get along.</li>
<li>I don’t need Google.</li>
<li>I don’t need third-party syncing tools.</li>
<li>And best of all, <strong>I can finally stop switching browsers every two weeks.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-the-browser-wars-were-a-lie"><strong>Final Thoughts: The Browser Wars Were a Lie</strong></h2>
<p>After all this research, testing, and <strong>questioning my life choices</strong>, I have one conclusion:</p>
<p><strong>All browsers are terrible.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some track you aggressively.</li>
<li>Some drain your battery.</li>
<li>Some crash randomly.</li>
<li>Some make you feel guilty for using them.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in the end? <strong>A browser is just a tool.</strong></p>
<p>The best one is <strong>the one that gets in your way the least.</strong></p>
<p>For me, that means:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Safari on iPhone</strong> (<em>because fighting Apple is exhausting</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>Edge on Windows</strong> (<em>because if all Chromium browsers are the same, I might as well pick the one with better Windows integration</em>).<br>
✔ <strong>iCloud Sync</strong> (<em>because I refuse to let Google own my bookmarks</em>).</p>
<p>Is it perfect? No.<br>
Is it better than switching browsers every week? <strong>Yes.</strong><br>
Will I probably change my mind in six months? <strong>Also yes.</strong></p>
<p>Because let’s be real—<strong>the moment you finally settle on a setup, something new comes along to break everything.</strong></p>
