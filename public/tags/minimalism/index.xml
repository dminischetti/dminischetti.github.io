      <description>Productivity isn‚Äôt about doing more‚Äîit‚Äôs about doing what matters. Discover how to escape the productivity trap and find real progress.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck"><strong>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought <strong>productivity was about doing more.</strong></p>
<p>‚úî More tasks.<br>
‚úî More efficiency.<br>
‚úî More checkboxes.</p>
<p>If I wasn‚Äôt constantly <strong>optimizing, planning, and squeezing every second</strong> for maximum output, I was failing.</p>
<p>And at first? <strong>It worked.</strong></p>
<p>I was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.</p>
<p>But then something strange happened.</p>
<p>Despite all my so-called <strong>productivity</strong>, I felt like I was going <strong>nowhere.</strong></p>
<p>‚ùå <strong>Busy, but not fulfilled.</strong><br>
‚ùå <strong>Efficient, but not effective.</strong><br>
‚ùå <strong>Always working, but never actually moving forward.</strong></p>
<p>And that‚Äôs when I realized: <strong>The way we think about productivity is broken.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-false-promise-of-getting-more-done"><strong>The False Promise of ‚ÄúGetting More Done‚Äù</strong></h2>
<p>Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a <strong>lie</strong>:</p>
<p>üõë That the key to success is <strong>efficiency</strong>.<br>
üõë That if we just optimize our time <strong>perfectly</strong>, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we‚Äôll finally get ahead.</p>
<p>But here‚Äôs the truth:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-is-not-about-getting-more-things-done-its-about-getting-the"><strong>Productivity is not about getting more things done. It‚Äôs about getting the <em>right</em> things done.</strong></h3>
<p>And if you‚Äôre not careful, <strong>‚Äúbeing productive‚Äù can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.</strong></p>
<p>I call it <strong>The Productivity Trap.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-productivity-trap-works"><strong>How The Productivity Trap Works</strong></h2>
<p>This is how most people approach work:</p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>You feel overwhelmed.</strong> Too much to do, not enough time.<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>You try to optimize.</strong> Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>You get efficient&hellip; at the wrong things.</strong> Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually <em>matters.</em><br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>You stay stuck in a loop of busyness.</strong> Always ‚Äúdoing,‚Äù never really progressing.</p>
<p>This is the scary part:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-can-feel-like-progress-even-when-its-just-motion"><strong>Productivity can feel like progress, even when it‚Äôs just motion.</strong></h3>
<p>And that‚Äôs exactly how I got stuck for so long.</p>
<p>I was <strong>checking boxes but not moving forward</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>working hard but not working smart</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>busy‚Äîbut not productive.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-real-secret-to-productivity-subtraction-not-addition"><strong>The Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition</strong></h2>
<p>I used to ask myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I ask a <strong>better</strong> question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What can I remove?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Real productivity isn‚Äôt about <strong>adding</strong> more tasks.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs about:<br>
‚úî <strong>Eliminating distractions.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>Cutting useless work.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>Focusing on what actually moves the needle.</strong></p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how I flipped my mindset:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-stop-optimizing-the-unimportant"><strong>1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant</strong></h3>
<p>I used to spend <strong>hours</strong> tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.</p>
<p>It felt productive, but in reality? <strong>It was just procrastination in disguise.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does this task even matter?</em></li>
<li><em>Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, the best way to <strong>be more productive</strong> is to <strong>stop doing half the things you‚Äôre doing right now.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-8020-focus-shift"><strong>2. The 80/20 Focus Shift</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Pareto Principle</strong> says <strong>80% of results come from 20% of effort.</strong></p>
<p>But most of us spend time on the <strong>80% of tasks</strong> that don‚Äôt actually move the needle.</p>
<p>So instead of asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I ask:<br>
‚úî <em>What‚Äôs the 20% that will make the biggest impact?</em><br>
‚úî <em>What can I cut without any real consequence?</em></p>
<p>Then, I <strong>ruthlessly</strong> focus on the <strong>high-impact 20%</strong>‚Äîand let go of the rest.</p>
<p>This was a game-changer for me. It‚Äôs not about <strong>doing everything</strong>. It‚Äôs about doing <strong>the right things.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-single-tasking-the-real-superpower"><strong>3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower</strong></h3>
<p>I used to <strong>pride myself on multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>But <strong>multitasking isn‚Äôt working faster‚Äîit‚Äôs working worse.</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs just rapidly <strong>switching between tasks</strong>, losing focus each time.</p>
<p>Now, I do the opposite:</p>
<p>‚úî <strong>One tab at a time.</strong> No distractions.<br>
‚úî <strong>One task at a time.</strong> Full focus, deep work.<br>
‚úî <strong>One decision at a time.</strong> No jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>It <strong>feels</strong> slower, but in reality? <strong>It‚Äôs 10x more effective.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-the-do-less-but-better-rule"><strong>4. The ‚ÄúDo Less, But Better‚Äù Rule</strong></h3>
<p>Most people try to do everything <strong>at 70% effort.</strong></p>
<p>They spread themselves too thin, and their work <strong>suffers.</strong></p>
<p>But the real magic happens when you:</p>
<p>‚úî Do <strong>fewer</strong> things, but do them <strong>exceptionally well.</strong><br>
‚úî Say <strong>no</strong> to everything that doesn‚Äôt align with your goals.<br>
‚úî Focus on <strong>quality over quantity.</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, by <strong>doing less, you achieve more.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway-stop-measuring-productivity-by-output"><strong>The Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest shift I made?</p>
<p>I stopped measuring productivity by <strong>how much I do.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, I measure it by:</p>
<p>‚úî <strong>How much progress I make on things that actually matter.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>How much energy I have left at the end of the day.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.</strong></p>
<p>I stopped asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And started asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How can I do less, but better?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="if-youre-feeling-stuck-try-this"><strong>If You‚Äôre Feeling Stuck, Try This</strong></h2>
<p>If you‚Äôve been <strong>optimizing, planning, and working harder</strong>‚Äîbut still feel stuck?</p>
<p>Try the <strong>opposite.</strong></p>
<p>‚úî Instead of doing more, <strong>do less‚Äîstrategically.</strong><br>
‚úî Instead of working harder, <strong>work on the right things.</strong><br>
‚úî Instead of chasing efficiency, <strong>chase clarity.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>the most productive people</strong> aren‚Äôt the ones who get the most done.</p>
<p>They‚Äôre the ones who <strong>do what matters‚Äîand ignore everything else.</strong></p>
<p>That‚Äôs the secret.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not about <strong>doing more.</strong><br>
It‚Äôs about <strong>doing less‚Äîbut doing it better.</strong></p>

      <description>Minimalism taken to the next level‚Äîfinding the one perfect item for everything. Discover my quest for ultimate efficiency and portability.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything"><strong>The Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything</strong></h1>
<p>Most people <strong>collect things</strong>. I <strong>eliminate them</strong>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale <strong>mission to find the absolute best</strong>‚Äîthe <strong>one</strong> perfect item in every category‚Äîso I never have to think about it again.</p>
<p>‚úî One <strong>backpack.</strong><br>
‚úî One <strong>pen.</strong><br>
‚úî One <strong>pencil.</strong><br>
‚úî One <strong>bathroom set.</strong></p>
<p>Everything I own must be <strong>the best, the most compact, the most portable.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Because life is unpredictable. One day you‚Äôre settled, the next, you‚Äôre packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.</p>
<p>üîπ <strong>Not as objects, but as decisions.</strong></p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want five backpacks‚ÄîI want <strong>one that does it all</strong>.<br>
I don‚Äôt want a drawer full of pens‚ÄîI want <strong>one that feels perfect in my hand</strong>.<br>
I don‚Äôt want a cluttered bathroom‚ÄîI want <strong>one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt just minimalism.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs <strong>ruthless optimization.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-rules-of-the-game"><strong>The Rules of the Game</strong></h2>
<p>Finding <strong>The One</strong> is an <strong>art form</strong>. It‚Äôs not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It‚Äôs about <strong>functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.</strong></p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Compactness is king.</strong> If it‚Äôs too bulky, it‚Äôs out. <strong>Portability without sacrifice.</strong><br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>One item, zero regrets.</strong> Once I pick The One, I‚Äôm committed. No backups, no alternatives. <strong>This is my Excalibur.</strong><br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>Quality over everything.</strong> If it doesn‚Äôt last, it doesn‚Äôt belong. <strong>No disposable junk.</strong><br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ <strong>No over-engineered nonsense.</strong> If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I <strong>don‚Äôt want it</strong>. Keep it <strong>simple, durable, and effective.</strong></p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt about <strong>being cheap</strong>. It‚Äôs about <strong>investing in the best, once</strong>‚Äîand then <strong>never thinking about it again.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-search-is-brutal"><strong>The Search is Brutal</strong></h2>
<p>You‚Äôd think this would be easy. It‚Äôs not.</p>
<p>Finding the <strong>one</strong> perfect item in any category means sifting through <strong>a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right</strong> options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The best backpack?</strong> Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. <strong>After weeks of research, I find one. Then‚Ä¶ a new contender appears. The cycle repeats.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The best pen?</strong> Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn‚Äôt scream <em>pretentious fountain pen guy</em>. <strong>Found it. But wait‚Äîshould I test one more?</strong></li>
<li><strong>The best toothbrush?</strong> Yes, even <strong>this</strong> is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. <strong>Why is this so hard?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each decision is a <strong>battle</strong>. A <strong>war between function and obsession.</strong></p>
<p>And the internet doesn‚Äôt make it easier. Every time I think I‚Äôve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.</p>
<p>‚ùå <em>‚ÄúThis backpack is perfect‚Ä¶ but the zipper is flimsy.‚Äù</em><br>
‚ùå <em>‚ÄúThis pen is incredible‚Ä¶ but it smudges if you‚Äôre left-handed.‚Äù</em><br>
‚ùå <em>‚ÄúThis toothbrush is great‚Ä¶ but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>I fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make <strong>spreadsheets</strong> with pros and cons.</p>
<p>Yes, I‚Äôm <strong>that person.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-i-love-this-insanity"><strong>Why I Love This Insanity</strong></h2>
<p>Some people call it <strong>overthinking</strong>.</p>
<p>I call it <strong>engineering my life for efficiency.</strong></p>
<p>Because once I‚Äôve chosen <strong>The One</strong>, <strong>I‚Äôm free.</strong></p>
<p>‚úÖ No more switching.<br>
‚úÖ No more rebuying.<br>
‚úÖ No more second-guessing.</p>
<p>Just <strong>one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs about <strong>reducing decision fatigue</strong>. It‚Äôs about <strong>knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me</strong>. It‚Äôs about <strong>portability, mobility, and adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also about <strong>being prepared</strong>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve moved across continents <strong>multiple times</strong>. I know what it‚Äôs like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the <strong>freedom of traveling light</strong> and the <strong>nightmare of clutter</strong>.</p>
<p>So when the <strong>next big move</strong> happens‚Äîwhether across a city or across a continent‚ÄîI‚Äôll be ready.</p>
<p>‚ùå <strong>No clutter.</strong><br>
‚ùå <strong>No baggage.</strong><br>
‚úÖ <strong>Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-final-boss-battle-of-minimalism"><strong>The Final Boss Battle of Minimalism</strong></h2>
<p>I‚Äôm not naive.</p>
<p>I know <strong>The One</strong> doesn‚Äôt really exist. There‚Äôs always something new, always a better version coming out.</p>
<p>But the pursuit isn‚Äôt just about the object‚Äîit‚Äôs about <strong>the mindset.</strong></p>
<p>It‚Äôs about <strong>curating my life</strong> to be as <strong>efficient and effective as possible</strong>. It‚Äôs about <strong>choosing quality over quantity</strong> in every decision.</p>
<p>So if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought‚Ä¶ just know I‚Äôm in the <strong>final boss battle of minimalism</strong>.</p>
<p>And when I finally find <strong>The One</strong>?</p>
<p>‚úî <strong>I‚Äôll stop looking.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>Until the next perfect version comes out.</strong> üòâ</p>

      <title>The Best Everyday Backpack? My Never-Ending Search for the Perfect One</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-eternal-struggle-of-finding-the-perfect-backpack/</guid>
      <description>The quest for the perfect backpack feels like an endless life mission. From too many pockets to uncomfortable straps, the search continues.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don‚Äôt know why, but finding the right backpack feels like <strong>a life quest</strong>‚Äîlike I‚Äôm a video game character on an <strong>endless side mission</strong>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve owned <strong>plenty of backpacks</strong>. But none of them have ever been <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs always <em>something</em> off.</p>
<p>‚úî <strong>Too big. Too small.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>Too many pockets. Not enough pockets.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>Feels great when empty. Turns into a brick when full.</strong></p>
<p>And yet, <strong>the search continues</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-backpack-goldilocks-zone"><strong>The Backpack Goldilocks Zone</strong></h2>
<p>I know what I want‚Äîat least, in theory.</p>
<p>‚úî <strong>Compact but spacious</strong> ‚Äì Big enough for a water bottle, light jacket, emergency battery, and some snacks. But not so big that I look like I‚Äôm about to hike the Appalachian Trail.<br>
‚úî <strong>Lightweight but durable</strong> ‚Äì Because I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm carrying bricks, but I also don‚Äôt want it falling apart in six months.<br>
‚úî <strong>Minimalist but functional</strong> ‚Äì Clean design. No excessive straps, no giant logos, no 42 different compartments for things I‚Äôll forget I even packed.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, right?</p>
<p>You‚Äôd think so.</p>
<p>But every time I think I‚Äôve found <strong>‚Äúthe one‚Äù</strong>, it ends up being&hellip; <strong>not quite right.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs either <strong>too bulky</strong> when half-empty or <strong>too tight</strong> when fully loaded.</li>
<li>It looks perfect <strong>online</strong> but feels terrible <strong>in real life</strong>.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs either an <strong>endless black hole</strong> or a <strong>maze of tiny compartments that make me question my own memory</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôm not asking for a <strong>magic bag of holding</strong>.<br>
Just a <strong>backpack that actually fits my daily life</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-backpacks-that-have-let-me-down"><strong>The Backpacks That Have Let Me Down</strong></h2>
<p>I‚Äôve tried them all.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-looks-perfect-but-feels-terrible-backpack"><strong>1. The ‚ÄúLooks Perfect But Feels Terrible‚Äù Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>I‚Äôve been betrayed by backpacks that <em>seem</em> like <strong>the one</strong>, only to realize:</p>
<ul>
<li>The straps <strong>dig into my shoulders like tiny instruments of torture</strong>.</li>
<li>The padding looks comfortable, but after an hour of walking, <strong>my shoulders are on fire</strong>.</li>
<li>Even the most &ldquo;ergonomic&rdquo; designs somehow turn into <strong>medieval punishment devices</strong> when I‚Äôm rushing through NYC.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-the-endless-black-hole-backpack"><strong>2. The ‚ÄúEndless Black Hole‚Äù Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>You know the kind. <strong>No organization, just one giant pocket</strong> where everything disappears.</p>
<p>Want your keys? Hope you enjoy <strong>an archaeological dig</strong>.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs always the same scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I‚Äôm in a rush.</li>
<li>The thing I need is <strong>somewhere</strong> at the bottom.</li>
<li>I dig through <strong>tangled charging cables, crumpled receipts, and a water bottle that somehow went horizontal</strong>.</li>
<li>By the time I find my keys, I‚Äôm questioning <strong>every decision that led me to this moment</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-the-too-many-compartments-backpack"><strong>3. The ‚ÄúToo Many Compartments‚Äù Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>At first, it seems genius. A <strong>special pocket for everything!</strong></p>
<p>Then, a month later, I can‚Äôt remember where <em>anything</em> is.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a <strong>scavenger hunt</strong> every time I need my headphones.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a pocket for my phone, a <strong>secret compartment for my wallet</strong>, a tiny slot for pens, and another one&hellip; for&hellip; <strong>what was that even for?</strong></p>
<p>The more <strong>organized</strong> it tries to be, the more <strong>chaotic</strong> my life becomes.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-why-is-this-so-heavy-backpack"><strong>4. The ‚ÄúWhy Is This So Heavy?!‚Äù Backpack</strong></h3>
<p>Empty, it <strong>already</strong> feels like I‚Äôm carrying bricks.</p>
<p>Add a laptop and a water bottle, and suddenly I need <strong>physical therapy</strong>.</p>
<p>I try to be a <strong>minimalist</strong>, but the backpack itself <strong>sabotages me</strong>.</p>
<p>Now I <strong>check product descriptions</strong> for the <strong>empty weight</strong> before even considering a purchase.</p>
<p>If it feels heavy in the store, <strong>it‚Äôs already dead to me</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-do-i-even-care-this-much"><strong>Why Do I Even Care This Much?</strong></h2>
<p>I know this sounds <strong>ridiculous</strong>.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It‚Äôs just a backpack, right?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>But here‚Äôs the thing:</p>
<p>A backpack is <strong>a daily companion</strong>.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs with you through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long walks.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Commutes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Unexpected errands.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Last-minute snack storage emergencies.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>right</em> one makes life <strong>easier</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>wrong</em> one? <strong>An endless source of frustration</strong>.</p>
<p>And when you live in <strong>New York</strong>, where you‚Äôre <strong>constantly moving</strong>, your backpack is <strong>an extension of yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm <strong>walking miles every day</strong>.<br>
I‚Äôm <strong>squeezing into crowded subway cars</strong>.<br>
I‚Äôm <strong>weaving through tourist mobs in Times Square</strong>.</p>
<p>I need a backpack that <strong>moves with me</strong>‚Äînot <strong>against me</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to <strong>forget</strong> it‚Äôs even there, not <strong>curse its existence</strong> every time I try to get my MetroCard.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-minimalists-dilemma"><strong>The Minimalist‚Äôs Dilemma</strong></h2>
<p>I‚Äôm not just looking for a backpack.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm looking for <strong>the one.</strong><br>
The <strong>last backpack I‚Äôll ever need</strong>.</p>
<p>I love <strong>minimalism</strong>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm on a mission to find:<br>
‚úî <strong>One perfect item</strong> for every category in my life.<br>
‚úî <strong>One pen. One jacket. One bag.</strong><br>
‚úî <strong>No backups. No alternatives. Just the best version of everything I use.</strong></p>
<p>So when it comes to a backpack, it‚Äôs not just about <strong>functionality</strong>.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs about <strong>perfection.</strong></p>
<p>Because if I find <strong>the right one</strong>, I‚Äôll <strong>never</strong> have to think about backpacks again.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs the problem, isn‚Äôt it?</p>
<p><strong>I keep thinking about backpacks.</strong><br>
I keep <strong>testing, trying, and switching</strong>.</p>
<p>Because <strong>none of them have been ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="will-i-ever-find-the-one"><strong>Will I Ever Find ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù?</strong></h2>
<p>I‚Äôd love to say I‚Äôve <strong>finally found my perfect backpack</strong>, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äî<strong>this is an ongoing saga.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe <strong>the</strong> backpack is out there, waiting for me to discover it.</li>
<li>Maybe it doesn‚Äôt exist, and I‚Äôll just cycle through <strong>20 more before giving up</strong>.</li>
<li>Maybe, like some kind of <strong>minimalist curse</strong>, I‚Äôm doomed to be haunted by this search forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Just maybe‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>The real perfect backpack was the friends we made along the way.</strong></p>
<p>(But also, if you have any recommendations, <em>please</em> let me know. The search continues.)</p>
