      <description>A love story told in the quiet moments of working from home together.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work from home in an <strong>old Brooklyn apartment</strong> with high ceilings, creaky floors, and a history that whispers through the walls.</p>
<p>Our study is actually our daughter’s bedroom during off-hours, <strong>repurposed as a workspace</strong> where my wife and I sit at separate desks.<br>
Just enough space to pass between us. Close, but not too close—<strong>perfect for love and concentration.</strong></p>
<p>She’s studying to become an <strong>elementary school teacher</strong>, headphones on, eyes locked on her screen, so intensely focused that I’m convinced she could ignore a fire drill.<br>
I’m right beside her, <strong>lost in lines of PHP code</strong>, wrestling with bugs that refuse to die.</p>
<p>We don’t speak while we work. <strong>Not a word.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not that we don’t want to.<br>
It’s that we <strong>can’t afford to.</strong></p>
<p>Because if I say even a simple <em>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo;</em>, <strong>it’s over.</strong></p>
<p>Our daughter would appear out of nowhere, demanding to know why <strong>unicorns are magical</strong> or how <strong>rainbows work.</strong><br>
The baby would start crying, because <strong>chaos loves company.</strong><br>
And just like that, our fragile focus would shatter into a million pieces.</p>
<p>So, instead? <strong>We live in silence.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="secret-messages-without-saying-a-word"><strong>Secret Messages (Without Saying a Word)</strong></h2>
<p>Back when we first met at work, we <strong>flirted from separate desks</strong>, sending each other cheeky messages on the company chat.<br>
We couldn’t talk aloud—professionalism and all—but we found ways to make each other smile.</p>
<p>Not much has changed. <strong>We still send each other secret notes.</strong></p>
<p>Except now, they’re digital.</p>
<p>I’ll text her from two desks away:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Did you see the email?”</strong> (<em>Translation: “I miss you.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>“What’s for lunch?”</strong> (<em>Translation: “You’re beautiful.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>“This bug is killing me.”</strong> (<em>Translation: “I love you.”</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our messages are <strong>coded love notes</strong>, little signals in the middle of the workday.<br>
They keep us connected, even in silence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="stolen-glances-and-hidden-smiles"><strong>Stolen Glances and Hidden Smiles</strong></h2>
<p>I steal glances at her when she’s not looking.</p>
<p>Her laptop is open, her notes are neatly organized, and she has that look of <strong>fierce determination</strong> that could move mountains.</p>
<p>She’s beautiful, even when she’s stressed, even when she’s muttering facts under her breath.<br>
I want to tell her. But I don’t.</p>
<p>Because if I break the silence? <strong>The whole system collapses.</strong></p>
<p>We’d lose focus.<br>
Our daughter would rush in with questions.<br>
The baby would follow.<br>
And our carefully structured workday would spiral into <strong>pure chaos.</strong></p>
<p>So, instead, <strong>I stay silent.</strong><br>
And somehow, that silence says everything.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-silence-is-my-favorite-sound"><strong>Why This Silence is My Favorite Sound</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes, I hate working from home.<br>
I hate how <strong>work and life blur together</strong>, how emails never stop, how meetings pop up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>But <strong>I love this.</strong></p>
<p>I love this strange, quiet dance we do.<br>
I love the way we communicate without words, how we’re together yet apart.</p>
<p>I love the way she chews on her pen when she’s thinking, the way she sighs when she’s frustrated, the way she whispers to herself while studying.<br>
I love every little thing <strong>she doesn’t realize I notice.</strong></p>
<p>And even though she won’t look up, even though she’s too busy to see me staring—</p>
<p><strong>I smile.</strong></p>
<p>Because she’s mine.<br>
She’s always been mine.<br>
And in this <strong>shared silence, we’re still falling in love.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-invisible-love-story"><strong>The Invisible Love Story</strong></h2>
<p>This is our life.<br>
Our love.<br>
Our silence.</p>
<p>And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
<p>It’s not always perfect. We fight. We get tired. We get stressed.<br>
But in this space, in this shared silence, <strong>we find each other.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about grand gestures. It’s not about dramatic declarations.<br>
It’s about <strong>the little things.</strong></p>
<p>It’s the way she hands me my coffee without a word.<br>
It’s the way I fix her chair without her asking.<br>
It’s the way we both know when the other needs a break, even if we don’t say it.</p>
<p>It’s the way <strong>our love speaks in silence.</strong></p>
<p>And even on the hardest days, even when the baby cries, even when the code breaks—</p>
<p>I look at her and I know:</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly where I’m meant to be.</strong></p>

      <title>The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive</title>

      <description>Multitasking is a lie. Discover why single-tasking is the real productivity superpower and how it’s transforming my focus and life.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-multitasking-myth-why-doing-less-makes-you-more-productive"><strong>The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought I had <strong>cracked the code</strong> to getting things done.</p>
<p>I was a multitasker—<strong>a master of spinning plates.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Answering messages while debugging code.<br>
✔ Cooking dinner while listening to a tech podcast.<br>
✔ Planning my week while pushing a stroller.</p>
<p>I convinced myself this was <strong>peak efficiency</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="turns-out-i-was-dead-wrong"><strong>Turns out, I was dead wrong.</strong></h3>
<p>Multitasking isn’t a productivity hack. It’s <strong>a scam</strong>.</p>
<p>And worse? <strong>It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-hidden-cost-of-doing-it-all"><strong>The Hidden Cost of Doing It All</strong></h2>
<p>We live in a world that <strong>worships multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>🖥 Job descriptions praise it.<br>
📈 Productivity gurus preach it.<br>
📱 If you’re not multitasking, you’re “falling behind.”</p>
<p>But science—and <strong>my own experience</strong>—beg to differ.</p>
<p>Multitasking isn’t <strong>actually</strong> doing two things at once.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>rapid task-switching</strong>.</p>
<p>And every time you switch, your brain <strong>pays a price.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jumping between Slack messages and writing code?</strong> You’re not doubling your output—you’re introducing micro-delays that slow you down.</li>
<li><strong>Checking your phone while spending time with family?</strong> You’re mentally buffering between two worlds—never fully present in either.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to think multitasking kept me <strong>ahead</strong>.</p>
<p>But it was actually the <strong>thing keeping me stuck.</strong></p>
<p>I was <strong>always busy</strong> but never <em>truly</em> productive.</p>
<p>Then, I read something that <strong>hit me like a brick:</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-ability-to-single-task-is-becoming-a-superpower"><strong>“The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.”</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s when <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-heres-what-im-doing-instead"><strong>So Here’s What I’m Doing Instead</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve started embracing <strong>single-tasking</strong> like my productivity depends on it—<strong>because it does.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-time-blocking-20"><strong>1. Time-Blocking 2.0</strong></h3>
<p>I used to schedule my day <strong>down to the minute</strong>.</p>
<p>It only made me <strong>stressed</strong> when things didn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>Now, I align tasks with my <strong>actual energy levels</strong>:<br>
✔ <strong>High-focus work</strong> when my brain is sharp.<br>
✔ <strong>Low-focus tasks</strong> when I’m running on fumes.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>working with my brain, not against it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-digital-decluttering"><strong>2. Digital Decluttering</strong></h3>
<p>I used to think a million open tabs meant <strong>I was working hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>It just meant <strong>I was distracted</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I:<br>
✔ <strong>Close unused tabs.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Write down what I actually need.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Handle tasks <em>one at a time.</em></strong></p>
<p>If something’s <strong>important</strong>, it goes on my <strong>Notion board</strong>.<br>
If it’s not? <strong>It’s gone.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-one-tab-rule"><strong>3. The “One-Tab Rule”</strong></h3>
<p>If my brain <strong>wants a second tab</strong>, it means <strong>I need a second task slot later—not now.</strong></p>
<p>This was <strong>tough</strong> as a developer.</p>
<p>I’m used to juggling:<br>
✔ <strong>Documentation</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Stack Overflow threads</strong><br>
✔ <strong>My IDE</strong></p>
<p>But once I stopped, my <strong>focus got sharper.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-thinking-in-depth-not-breadth"><strong>4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of <strong>half-absorbing</strong> five articles, I <strong>read one properly</strong>—and actually retain something.</p>
<p>✔ No more <strong>fake productivity.</strong><br>
✔ No more <strong>information overload.</strong></p>
<p>The result?<br>
✔ <strong>Deeper focus.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Lower stress.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Better work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Actually being present in my own life.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve been sold the lie that <strong>multitasking is the key to success.</strong></p>
<p>But what if the real key is <strong>the opposite?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a world where we:<br>
✔ Stop bragging about <strong>being busy</strong>.<br>
✔ Start taking pride in <strong>how well we do one thing at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine how different life would feel.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not perfect at it yet.</p>
<p>I still catch myself <strong>falling back into old habits</strong>:<br>
✔ Checking messages while pushing code.<br>
✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.</p>
<p>But now, I <strong>notice it.</strong></p>
<p>I stop.<br>
I refocus.</p>
<p>I’m done with the <strong>chaos.</strong></p>

      <title>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</title>

      <description>Productivity isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing what matters. Discover how to escape the productivity trap and find real progress.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck"><strong>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought <strong>productivity was about doing more.</strong></p>
<p>✔ More tasks.<br>
✔ More efficiency.<br>
✔ More checkboxes.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t constantly <strong>optimizing, planning, and squeezing every second</strong> for maximum output, I was failing.</p>
<p>And at first? <strong>It worked.</strong></p>
<p>I was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.</p>
<p>But then something strange happened.</p>
<p>Despite all my so-called <strong>productivity</strong>, I felt like I was going <strong>nowhere.</strong></p>
<p>❌ <strong>Busy, but not fulfilled.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Efficient, but not effective.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Always working, but never actually moving forward.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s when I realized: <strong>The way we think about productivity is broken.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-false-promise-of-getting-more-done"><strong>The False Promise of “Getting More Done”</strong></h2>
<p>Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a <strong>lie</strong>:</p>
<p>🛑 That the key to success is <strong>efficiency</strong>.<br>
🛑 That if we just optimize our time <strong>perfectly</strong>, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-is-not-about-getting-more-things-done-its-about-getting-the"><strong>Productivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the <em>right</em> things done.</strong></h3>
<p>And if you’re not careful, <strong>“being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.</strong></p>
<p>I call it <strong>The Productivity Trap.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-productivity-trap-works"><strong>How The Productivity Trap Works</strong></h2>
<p>This is how most people approach work:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>You feel overwhelmed.</strong> Too much to do, not enough time.<br>
2️⃣ <strong>You try to optimize.</strong> Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.<br>
3️⃣ <strong>You get efficient&hellip; at the wrong things.</strong> Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually <em>matters.</em><br>
4️⃣ <strong>You stay stuck in a loop of busyness.</strong> Always “doing,” never really progressing.</p>
<p>This is the scary part:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-can-feel-like-progress-even-when-its-just-motion"><strong>Productivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion.</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.</p>
<p>I was <strong>checking boxes but not moving forward</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>working hard but not working smart</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>busy—but not productive.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-real-secret-to-productivity-subtraction-not-addition"><strong>The Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition</strong></h2>
<p>I used to ask myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I ask a <strong>better</strong> question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What can I remove?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Real productivity isn’t about <strong>adding</strong> more tasks.</p>
<p>It’s about:<br>
✔ <strong>Eliminating distractions.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Cutting useless work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Focusing on what actually moves the needle.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I flipped my mindset:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-stop-optimizing-the-unimportant"><strong>1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant</strong></h3>
<p>I used to spend <strong>hours</strong> tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.</p>
<p>It felt productive, but in reality? <strong>It was just procrastination in disguise.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does this task even matter?</em></li>
<li><em>Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, the best way to <strong>be more productive</strong> is to <strong>stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-8020-focus-shift"><strong>2. The 80/20 Focus Shift</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Pareto Principle</strong> says <strong>80% of results come from 20% of effort.</strong></p>
<p>But most of us spend time on the <strong>80% of tasks</strong> that don’t actually move the needle.</p>
<p>So instead of asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I ask:<br>
✔ <em>What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?</em><br>
✔ <em>What can I cut without any real consequence?</em></p>
<p>Then, I <strong>ruthlessly</strong> focus on the <strong>high-impact 20%</strong>—and let go of the rest.</p>
<p>This was a game-changer for me. It’s not about <strong>doing everything</strong>. It’s about doing <strong>the right things.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-single-tasking-the-real-superpower"><strong>3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower</strong></h3>
<p>I used to <strong>pride myself on multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>But <strong>multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.</strong></p>
<p>It’s just rapidly <strong>switching between tasks</strong>, losing focus each time.</p>
<p>Now, I do the opposite:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>One tab at a time.</strong> No distractions.<br>
✔ <strong>One task at a time.</strong> Full focus, deep work.<br>
✔ <strong>One decision at a time.</strong> No jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>It <strong>feels</strong> slower, but in reality? <strong>It’s 10x more effective.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-the-do-less-but-better-rule"><strong>4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>Most people try to do everything <strong>at 70% effort.</strong></p>
<p>They spread themselves too thin, and their work <strong>suffers.</strong></p>
<p>But the real magic happens when you:</p>
<p>✔ Do <strong>fewer</strong> things, but do them <strong>exceptionally well.</strong><br>
✔ Say <strong>no</strong> to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.<br>
✔ Focus on <strong>quality over quantity.</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, by <strong>doing less, you achieve more.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway-stop-measuring-productivity-by-output"><strong>The Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest shift I made?</p>
<p>I stopped measuring productivity by <strong>how much I do.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, I measure it by:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>How much progress I make on things that actually matter.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much energy I have left at the end of the day.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.</strong></p>
<p>I stopped asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And started asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How can I do less, but better?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="if-youre-feeling-stuck-try-this"><strong>If You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This</strong></h2>
<p>If you’ve been <strong>optimizing, planning, and working harder</strong>—but still feel stuck?</p>
<p>Try the <strong>opposite.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Instead of doing more, <strong>do less—strategically.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of working harder, <strong>work on the right things.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, <strong>chase clarity.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>the most productive people</strong> aren’t the ones who get the most done.</p>
<p>They’re the ones who <strong>do what matters—and ignore everything else.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the secret.</p>
<p>It’s not about <strong>doing more.</strong><br>
It’s about <strong>doing less—but doing it better.</strong></p>

      <title>I Never Thought I’d Grow a Beard (But Here We Are)</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>Growing a beard was never in my plans. But this accidental experiment taught me more about identity than I expected.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been a <strong>beard guy.</strong></p>
<p>For most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just <strong>happened</strong> to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age. I’d see guys with <strong>thick, full beards</strong> and think, <em>Yeah, that’s just not for me.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I shave because I always have.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>I’m just not a beard person.</strong></p>
<p>And then, one day&hellip; <strong>I didn’t shave.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-accidental-beard-experiment"><strong>The Accidental Beard Experiment</strong></h2>
<p>I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, <em>I shall grow a beard!</em></p>
<p>It started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had <strong>more stubble than usual.</strong></p>
<p>Normally, this would have <strong>annoyed me.</strong> But this time?</p>
<p>I let it stay.</p>
<p>At first, it felt weird—like my <strong>own face was betraying me.</strong> I&rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, <em>Who is this guy?</em></p>
<p>The <strong>itchy phase</strong> was real.<br>
The <strong>awkward patchy phase</strong> was even more real.</p>
<p>But the strangest part?</p>
<p>I <strong>kind of liked it.</strong></p>
<p>I started noticing little things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It made me <strong>look older</strong> (or maybe just <em>different</em>).</li>
<li>It <strong>changed the shape of my face.</strong></li>
<li>I kept catching myself <strong>stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a <strong>reminder</strong> that something was changing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-growing-a-beard-felt-so-different"><strong>Why Growing a Beard Felt So… Different</strong></h2>
<p>It’s funny how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can change the way you see yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I looked different.</strong> My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a <strong>real-life Instagram filter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I felt different.</strong> There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more <strong>deliberate.</strong> Like I had <em>made a choice</em>, even if that choice was just to&hellip; not shave.</li>
<li><strong>Other people noticed.</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;You look… more Italian now.&rdquo;</em> (<em>That one made me laugh.</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn’t prepared for how much <strong>other people</strong> would comment on it. It was like I had <strong>changed something huge</strong>, when all I did was&hellip; <em>nothing.</em></p>
<p>And every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of <strong>pride and discomfort.</strong> Like I was being <strong>seen in a new way</strong>—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-letting-my-face-do-its-thing"><strong>What I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing</strong></h2>
<p>Growing a beard <strong>didn’t change my life.</strong></p>
<p>But it did make me <strong>realize something important.</strong></p>
<p>So many of the things we believe about ourselves—our <strong>“defaults”</strong>—aren’t actually rules. They’re just <strong>habits.</strong></p>
<p>For years, I thought:<br>
✔ <em>I’m a clean-shaven guy.</em><br>
✔ <em>Beards don’t suit me.</em><br>
✔ <em>This is just how I look.</em></p>
<p>And then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” <strong>disappeared.</strong></p>
<p>It made me wonder:<br>
<em>How many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I’m not a morning person.</strong> (<em>Or am I just used to staying up late?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I don’t like public speaking.</strong> (<em>Or have I just never given it a real chance?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I’m not a beard guy.</strong> (<em>Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s strange how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can make you question so much more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="will-i-keep-it"><strong>Will I Keep It?</strong></h2>
<p>I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll <strong>shave it off next week.</strong><br>
Maybe I’ll <strong>keep it longer.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m just <strong>letting it be.</strong></p>
<p>No expectations. No rules. Just <strong>curiosity.</strong></p>
<p>But either way, this isn’t really about the beard.</p>
<p>It’s about realizing that sometimes, <strong>the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>That’s worth exploring.</strong></p>

      <description>Change isn&amp;#39;t about willpower—it&amp;#39;s about identity. Discover why habits fail and how shifting your identity leads to lasting change.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works"><strong>Why We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)</strong></h1>
<p>I used to think change was about willpower.</p>
<p>If I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder. Push through resistance. Be disciplined.</p>
<p>I told myself, <em>“Just do it. No excuses.”</em></p>
<p>And for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.</p>
<p>But then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.</p>
<p>And every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.</p>
<p>Then I learned something that changed everything:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why"><strong>Why &ldquo;Trying Harder&rdquo; Never Works</strong></h2>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<p>Two people are offered a cigarette.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first person says, <em>“No thanks, I’m trying to quit.”</em></li>
<li>The second person says, <em>“No thanks, I don’t smoke.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first person is using willpower—constantly resisting.</li>
<li>The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why most habits fail.</p>
<p>We focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-identity-based-approach-to-change"><strong>The Identity-Based Approach to Change</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.</p>
<p>Every action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person.</li>
<li>If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer.</li>
<li>If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to stop seeing habits as things I <em>do</em> and start seeing them as things that define who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-im-rewiring-my-brain-for-lasting-change"><strong>How I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change</strong></h2>
<p>I started with small identity shifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of <em>“I should exercise more,”</em> I tell myself <em>“I’m the kind of person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to focus better,”</em> I remind myself <em>“I’m someone who works with deep focus.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to stop procrastinating,”</em> I say <em>“I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:</p>
<p><strong>The brain hates cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>
<p>When you tell yourself you <em>are</em> something, you subconsciously start acting like it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day.</li>
<li>If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes.</li>
<li>If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-trying-and-being"><strong>The Difference Between Trying and Being</strong></h2>
<p>I used to say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m trying to exercise more.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to focus better.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to wake up earlier.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now I say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m a person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m someone who works with focus.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m the kind of person who gets up early.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.</p>
<p>And identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Willpower is unreliable.<br>
Motivation fades.<br>
But identity sticks.</p>
<p>If you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.<br>
Start with who you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to read more? Become a reader.</li>
<li>Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health.</li>
<li>Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the truth is:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.</strong></p>
<p>Change who you are, and the actions will follow.</p>

      <title>The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck</title>

      <description>Motivation is a lie. Discover why waiting to feel inspired keeps you stuck and learn practical strategies to take action anyway.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck"><strong>The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I waited for <strong>motivation to strike</strong>.</p>
<p>I thought <strong>productive people</strong> had some kind of <strong>magical drive</strong> I didn’t.<br>
That one day, I’d wake up <strong>full of energy</strong>, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects <strong>without procrastinating</strong>.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>That day <strong>never came.</strong></p>
<p>And it never <em>will.</em></p>
<p>Because here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-lie"><strong>Motivation is a lie.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-motivation-doesnt-matter"><strong>Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve all said it:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I just need to get motivated.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ll start when I feel ready.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I don’t have the energy today.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But <strong>motivation isn’t something you <em>have</em>—it’s something you <em>create.</em></strong></p>
<p>We think <strong>action comes after motivation</strong>, when really, it’s the other way around.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-follows-action-not-the-other-way-around"><strong>Motivation follows action, not the other way around.</strong></h3>
<p>You don’t <strong>wait to feel inspired</strong> before starting.<br>
You start, and then <strong>inspiration finds you.</strong></p>
<p>Once I figured this out, <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<p>I used to wait for that <strong>perfect wave of motivation</strong>—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something:</p>
<h3 id="i-always-felt-more-motivated-after-i-started-not-before"><strong>I always felt more motivated after I started, not before.</strong></h3>
<p>Even if I <em>didn’t feel like it</em>—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.<br>
That’s when I realized:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-side-effect-of-action"><strong>Motivation is a side effect of action.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-actually-works-and-why-its-so-simple"><strong>What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple)</strong></h2>
<p>If I waited to <em>feel</em> motivated, I’d never do anything.</p>
<p>So instead, I follow <strong>three simple rules</strong> that make action inevitable:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-the-5-minute-rule"><strong>1. The 5-Minute Rule</strong></h3>
<p>If something feels overwhelming, I <strong>trick my brain</strong> by saying:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I’ll just do it for five minutes.</strong> That’s it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too tired to work out?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of exercise.</em></li>
<li><strong>Don’t want to start that project?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of brainstorming.</em></li>
<li><strong>Can’t focus on writing?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of bad first drafts.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>90% of the time, I keep going.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>starting is the hardest part.</strong> Once I’m in motion, <strong>momentum keeps me moving.</strong></p>
<p>And if I really <strong>do stop after five minutes?</strong><br>
At least I did <em>something</em>—and something is infinitely <strong>better than nothing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-no-emotion-rule"><strong>2. The “No Emotion” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>I stopped asking myself <strong>if I <em>felt</em> like doing something.</strong></p>
<p>Feelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d <strong>never get anything done.</strong></p>
<p>So I stopped negotiating with myself.</p>
<p>Now, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. <strong>No debates. No negotiations.</strong><br>
It’s just <strong>what I do.</strong></p>
<p>✔ <strong>Exercise?</strong> → <em>It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Writing?</strong> → <em>Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Starting work?</strong> → <em>Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Action first. Feelings later.</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly, <strong>once I start, motivation usually shows up.</strong></p>
<p>And if it doesn’t? <strong>Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-3-choice-trick"><strong>3. The 3-Choice Trick</strong></h3>
<p>When I don’t want to do something, I <strong>limit my options</strong> to just three:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>Do it now.</strong> (<em>Just start, even if it’s imperfect.</em>)<br>
2️⃣ <strong>Do it badly.</strong> (<em>Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.</em>)<br>
3️⃣ <strong>Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.</strong></p>
<p>Turns out, <strong>staring at a wall is boring.</strong> So I usually just do the thing.</p>
<p>This trick works because it eliminates <strong>all distractions</strong>.<br>
I’m not allowed to <strong>scroll on my phone</strong> or <strong>check social media</strong>.</p>
<p>My only choices?<br>
✔ <strong>Work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Do it badly.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-works-the-science-of-momentum"><strong>Why This Works: The Science of Momentum</strong></h2>
<p>Newton’s First Law of Motion states:</p>
<h3 id="an-object-at-rest-stays-at-rest-and-an-object-in-motion-stays-in-motion"><strong>“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.”</strong></h3>
<p>Turns out, <strong>this applies to humans too.</strong></p>
<p>When we’re at rest (<strong>not doing the thing</strong>), it feels <strong>impossible to get moving</strong>.<br>
But <strong>once we start</strong>, it’s <strong>easier to keep going.</strong></p>
<p>This is why the hardest part of any task is <strong>getting started.</strong><br>
It’s why the <strong>5-minute rule works so well</strong>.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>It breaks the inertia.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It removes overthinking.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It makes starting feel effortless.</strong></p>
<p>And once you’re moving? <strong>Momentum takes over.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about willpower.<br>
It’s about <strong>tricking your brain into motion.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-trap-its-not-coming-to-save-you"><strong>Motivation is a trap.</strong> It’s not coming to save you.</h3>
<p>If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.<br>
If you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.</p>
<p>But action? <strong>Action leads to momentum.</strong><br>
And <strong>momentum creates motivation.</strong></p>
<p>So next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Start for five minutes.</strong> (<em>Even if it’s terrible.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Do it without debating.</strong> (<em>Feelings can catch up later.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Give yourself only three choices.</strong> (<em>Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.</em>)</p>
<p>Because once you start, you <em>won’t</em> stop.</p>
<p>And when you stop needing motivation to begin, <strong>you’ll get more done than ever before.</strong></p>

      <title>Why Changing Your Mind is a Sign of Intelligence, Not Weakness</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>Changing your mind isn’t a weakness—it’s growth. Discover why evolving your perspective makes you smarter and more adaptable.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people think <strong>changing your mind is a weakness</strong>—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That <strong>certainty equals strength</strong> and doubt makes you unreliable.</p>
<p>I <strong>completely disagree.</strong></p>
<p>I change my mind <strong>all the time.</strong> Not because I’m indecisive, but because <strong>I’m learning.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-art-of-arguing-with-yourself"><strong>The Art of Arguing With Yourself</strong></h2>
<p>It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, <strong>your brain worked hard to form it.</strong></p>
<p>And then, suddenly&hellip; doubt creeps in.</p>
<p>You start thinking about the <strong>opposite perspective.</strong> You challenge your own logic. You realize, <em>maybe I was missing something.</em></p>
<p>Some people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: <strong>every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve realized that my opinions are just <strong>snapshots</strong> of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need <strong>updates.</strong></p>
<p>I constantly ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What if I’m wrong?</em></li>
<li><em>What am I not considering?</em></li>
<li><em>How would someone who disagrees with me see this?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I argue <strong>against my own beliefs</strong> to test their strength. I look for <strong>holes in my logic.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t being indecisive. <strong>This is debugging my own thinking.</strong></p>
<p>And every time I find a flaw, I fix it. <strong>I upgrade.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="marriage-the-ultimate-debate-club"><strong>Marriage: The Ultimate Debate Club</strong></h2>
<p>If you want practice in <strong>changing your mind</strong>, get married.</p>
<p>My wife and I <strong>love</strong> to debate. Not argue—debate.</p>
<p>It starts with small things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is this really the best way to load the dishwasher?</em></li>
<li><em>Is a hot dog a sandwich?</em></li>
<li><em>Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, two hours later, we’re deep into <strong>life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.</strong></p>
<p>And sometimes, <strong>we completely switch sides.</strong></p>
<p>Not because one of us &ldquo;won.&rdquo;<br>
Not because we’re trying to be &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But because we actually <strong>listened</strong> to each other.</p>
<p>Because <strong>seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.</strong></p>
<p>And yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.<br>
(Okay, <strong>often</strong> she’s right, but that’s another story.)</p>
<p>But every time I admit I was wrong, <strong>I get smarter.</strong><br>
And every time she does, <strong>we both grow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-changing-your-mind-is-a-superpower"><strong>Why Changing Your Mind is a Superpower</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you never change your mind, <strong>you’re not learning.</strong> You’re just repeating yourself.</li>
<li>Admitting you were wrong <strong>doesn’t make you weak.</strong> It makes you someone people actually trust.</li>
<li>The smartest people <strong>aren’t the ones who refuse to budge.</strong> They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<p>Every time you change your mind, it means <strong>you’ve learned something new.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science evolves</strong> by questioning and updating its ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Great leaders</strong> adjust their strategies when new information comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Successful people</strong> don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing your mind <strong>doesn’t mean you were stupid before.</strong><br>
It means you’re <strong>smarter now.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t mean you were wrong.<br>
It means <strong>you’ve improved.</strong></p>
<p>And over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles <strong>the truth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="version-20-and-beyond"><strong>Version 2.0 (And Beyond)</strong></h2>
<p>I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.<br>
Now, I see it as <strong>a sign of growth.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to be <strong>version 1.0 of myself forever.</strong><br>
I want to be <strong>2.0, 3.0, 10.0</strong>—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.</p>
<p>Some people are <strong>proud of being &ldquo;consistent.&rdquo;</strong> But if you’re consistent <strong>just for the sake of consistency</strong>, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.</p>
<p>People who never change their minds? <strong>They’re frozen in time.</strong><br>
People who adapt, question, and rethink? <strong>They’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>And that means being willing to say,<br>
<em>&ldquo;I was wrong.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I learned something new.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It means embracing <strong>doubt, curiosity, and growth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>People think strength is about <strong>sticking to your guns no matter what.</strong><br>
But real strength? <strong>Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being <strong>curious</strong> enough to question yourself.</li>
<li>Being <strong>humble</strong> enough to admit when you’re wrong.</li>
<li>Being <strong>smart</strong> enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next time someone accuses you of <strong>flip-flopping</strong>, don’t take it as an insult.<br>
Take it as <strong>proof that you’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>Because the strongest minds?<br>
They’re the ones that <strong>never stop upgrading.</strong></p>
