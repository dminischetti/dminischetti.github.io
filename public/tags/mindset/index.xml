      <description>A love story told in the quiet moments of working from home together.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work from home in an <strong>old Brooklyn apartment</strong> with high ceilings, creaky floors, and a history that whispers through the walls.</p>
<p>Our study is actually our daughter’s bedroom during off-hours, <strong>repurposed as a workspace</strong> where my wife and I sit at separate desks.<br>
Just enough space to pass between us. Close, but not too close—<strong>perfect for love and concentration.</strong></p>
<p>She’s studying to become an <strong>elementary school teacher</strong>, headphones on, eyes locked on her screen, so intensely focused that I’m convinced she could ignore a fire drill.<br>
I’m right beside her, <strong>lost in lines of PHP code</strong>, wrestling with bugs that refuse to die.</p>
<p>We don’t speak while we work. <strong>Not a word.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not that we don’t want to.<br>
It’s that we <strong>can’t afford to.</strong></p>
<p>Because if I say even a simple <em>&ldquo;Hey&rdquo;</em>, <strong>it’s over.</strong></p>
<p>Our daughter would appear out of nowhere, demanding to know why <strong>unicorns are magical</strong> or how <strong>rainbows work.</strong><br>
The baby would start crying, because <strong>chaos loves company.</strong><br>
And just like that, our fragile focus would shatter into a million pieces.</p>
<p>So, instead? <strong>We live in silence.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="secret-messages-without-saying-a-word"><strong>Secret Messages (Without Saying a Word)</strong></h2>
<p>Back when we first met at work, we <strong>flirted from separate desks</strong>, sending each other cheeky messages on the company chat.<br>
We couldn’t talk aloud—professionalism and all—but we found ways to make each other smile.</p>
<p>Not much has changed. <strong>We still send each other secret notes.</strong></p>
<p>Except now, they’re digital.</p>
<p>I’ll text her from two desks away:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Did you see the email?”</strong> (<em>Translation: “I miss you.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>“What’s for lunch?”</strong> (<em>Translation: “You’re beautiful.”</em>)</li>
<li><strong>“This bug is killing me.”</strong> (<em>Translation: “I love you.”</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our messages are <strong>coded love notes</strong>, little signals in the middle of the workday.<br>
They keep us connected, even in silence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="stolen-glances-and-hidden-smiles"><strong>Stolen Glances and Hidden Smiles</strong></h2>
<p>I steal glances at her when she’s not looking.</p>
<p>Her laptop is open, her notes are neatly organized, and she has that look of <strong>fierce determination</strong> that could move mountains.</p>
<p>She’s beautiful, even when she’s stressed, even when she’s muttering facts under her breath.<br>
I want to tell her. But I don’t.</p>
<p>Because if I break the silence? <strong>The whole system collapses.</strong></p>
<p>We’d lose focus.<br>
Our daughter would rush in with questions.<br>
The baby would follow.<br>
And our carefully structured workday would spiral into <strong>pure chaos.</strong></p>
<p>So, instead, <strong>I stay silent.</strong><br>
And somehow, that silence says everything.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-silence-is-my-favorite-sound"><strong>Why This Silence is My Favorite Sound</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes, I hate working from home.<br>
I hate how <strong>work and life blur together</strong>, how emails never stop, how meetings pop up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>But <strong>I love this.</strong></p>
<p>I love this strange, quiet dance we do.<br>
I love the way we communicate without words, how we’re together yet apart.</p>
<p>I love the way she chews on her pen when she’s thinking, the way she sighs when she’s frustrated, the way she whispers to herself while studying.<br>
I love every little thing <strong>she doesn’t realize I notice.</strong></p>
<p>And even though she won’t look up, even though she’s too busy to see me staring—</p>
<p><strong>I smile.</strong></p>
<p>Because she’s mine.<br>
She’s always been mine.<br>
And in this <strong>shared silence, we’re still falling in love.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-invisible-love-story"><strong>The Invisible Love Story</strong></h2>
<p>This is our life.<br>
Our love.<br>
Our silence.</p>
<p>And I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
<p>It’s not always perfect. We fight. We get tired. We get stressed.<br>
But in this space, in this shared silence, <strong>we find each other.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about grand gestures. It’s not about dramatic declarations.<br>
It’s about <strong>the little things.</strong></p>
<p>It’s the way she hands me my coffee without a word.<br>
It’s the way I fix her chair without her asking.<br>
It’s the way we both know when the other needs a break, even if we don’t say it.</p>
<p>It’s the way <strong>our love speaks in silence.</strong></p>
<p>And even on the hardest days, even when the baby cries, even when the code breaks—</p>
<p>I look at her and I know:</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly where I’m meant to be.</strong></p>

      <title>The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive</title>

      <description>Multitasking is a lie. Discover why single-tasking is the real productivity superpower and how it’s transforming my focus and life.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-multitasking-myth-why-doing-less-makes-you-more-productive"><strong>The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought I had <strong>cracked the code</strong> to getting things done.</p>
<p>I was a multitasker—<strong>a master of spinning plates.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Answering messages while debugging code.<br>
✔ Cooking dinner while listening to a tech podcast.<br>
✔ Planning my week while pushing a stroller.</p>
<p>I convinced myself this was <strong>peak efficiency</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="turns-out-i-was-dead-wrong"><strong>Turns out, I was dead wrong.</strong></h3>
<p>Multitasking isn’t a productivity hack. It’s <strong>a scam</strong>.</p>
<p>And worse? <strong>It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-hidden-cost-of-doing-it-all"><strong>The Hidden Cost of Doing It All</strong></h2>
<p>We live in a world that <strong>worships multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>🖥 Job descriptions praise it.<br>
📈 Productivity gurus preach it.<br>
📱 If you’re not multitasking, you’re “falling behind.”</p>
<p>But science—and <strong>my own experience</strong>—beg to differ.</p>
<p>Multitasking isn’t <strong>actually</strong> doing two things at once.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>rapid task-switching</strong>.</p>
<p>And every time you switch, your brain <strong>pays a price.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jumping between Slack messages and writing code?</strong> You’re not doubling your output—you’re introducing micro-delays that slow you down.</li>
<li><strong>Checking your phone while spending time with family?</strong> You’re mentally buffering between two worlds—never fully present in either.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to think multitasking kept me <strong>ahead</strong>.</p>
<p>But it was actually the <strong>thing keeping me stuck.</strong></p>
<p>I was <strong>always busy</strong> but never <em>truly</em> productive.</p>
<p>Then, I read something that <strong>hit me like a brick:</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-ability-to-single-task-is-becoming-a-superpower"><strong>“The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.”</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s when <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-heres-what-im-doing-instead"><strong>So Here’s What I’m Doing Instead</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve started embracing <strong>single-tasking</strong> like my productivity depends on it—<strong>because it does.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-time-blocking-20"><strong>1. Time-Blocking 2.0</strong></h3>
<p>I used to schedule my day <strong>down to the minute</strong>.</p>
<p>It only made me <strong>stressed</strong> when things didn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>Now, I align tasks with my <strong>actual energy levels</strong>:<br>
✔ <strong>High-focus work</strong> when my brain is sharp.<br>
✔ <strong>Low-focus tasks</strong> when I’m running on fumes.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>working with my brain, not against it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-digital-decluttering"><strong>2. Digital Decluttering</strong></h3>
<p>I used to think a million open tabs meant <strong>I was working hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>It just meant <strong>I was distracted</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I:<br>
✔ <strong>Close unused tabs.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Write down what I actually need.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Handle tasks <em>one at a time.</em></strong></p>
<p>If something’s <strong>important</strong>, it goes on my <strong>Notion board</strong>.<br>
If it’s not? <strong>It’s gone.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-one-tab-rule"><strong>3. The “One-Tab Rule”</strong></h3>
<p>If my brain <strong>wants a second tab</strong>, it means <strong>I need a second task slot later—not now.</strong></p>
<p>This was <strong>tough</strong> as a developer.</p>
<p>I’m used to juggling:<br>
✔ <strong>Documentation</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Stack Overflow threads</strong><br>
✔ <strong>My IDE</strong></p>
<p>But once I stopped, my <strong>focus got sharper.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-thinking-in-depth-not-breadth"><strong>4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of <strong>half-absorbing</strong> five articles, I <strong>read one properly</strong>—and actually retain something.</p>
<p>✔ No more <strong>fake productivity.</strong><br>
✔ No more <strong>information overload.</strong></p>
<p>The result?<br>
✔ <strong>Deeper focus.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Lower stress.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Better work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Actually being present in my own life.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve been sold the lie that <strong>multitasking is the key to success.</strong></p>
<p>But what if the real key is <strong>the opposite?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a world where we:<br>
✔ Stop bragging about <strong>being busy</strong>.<br>
✔ Start taking pride in <strong>how well we do one thing at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine how different life would feel.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not perfect at it yet.</p>
<p>I still catch myself <strong>falling back into old habits</strong>:<br>
✔ Checking messages while pushing code.<br>
✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.</p>
<p>But now, I <strong>notice it.</strong></p>
<p>I stop.<br>
I refocus.</p>
<p>I’m done with the <strong>chaos.</strong></p>

      <title>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</title>

      <description>Productivity isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing what matters. Discover how to escape the productivity trap and find real progress.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck"><strong>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought <strong>productivity was about doing more.</strong></p>
<p>✔ More tasks.<br>
✔ More efficiency.<br>
✔ More checkboxes.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t constantly <strong>optimizing, planning, and squeezing every second</strong> for maximum output, I was failing.</p>
<p>And at first? <strong>It worked.</strong></p>
<p>I was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.</p>
<p>But then something strange happened.</p>
<p>Despite all my so-called <strong>productivity</strong>, I felt like I was going <strong>nowhere.</strong></p>
<p>❌ <strong>Busy, but not fulfilled.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Efficient, but not effective.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Always working, but never actually moving forward.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s when I realized: <strong>The way we think about productivity is broken.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-false-promise-of-getting-more-done"><strong>The False Promise of “Getting More Done”</strong></h2>
<p>Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a <strong>lie</strong>:</p>
<p>🛑 That the key to success is <strong>efficiency</strong>.<br>
🛑 That if we just optimize our time <strong>perfectly</strong>, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-is-not-about-getting-more-things-done-its-about-getting-the"><strong>Productivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the <em>right</em> things done.</strong></h3>
<p>And if you’re not careful, <strong>“being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.</strong></p>
<p>I call it <strong>The Productivity Trap.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-productivity-trap-works"><strong>How The Productivity Trap Works</strong></h2>
<p>This is how most people approach work:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>You feel overwhelmed.</strong> Too much to do, not enough time.<br>
2️⃣ <strong>You try to optimize.</strong> Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.<br>
3️⃣ <strong>You get efficient&hellip; at the wrong things.</strong> Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually <em>matters.</em><br>
4️⃣ <strong>You stay stuck in a loop of busyness.</strong> Always “doing,” never really progressing.</p>
<p>This is the scary part:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-can-feel-like-progress-even-when-its-just-motion"><strong>Productivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion.</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.</p>
<p>I was <strong>checking boxes but not moving forward</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>working hard but not working smart</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>busy—but not productive.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-real-secret-to-productivity-subtraction-not-addition"><strong>The Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition</strong></h2>
<p>I used to ask myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I ask a <strong>better</strong> question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What can I remove?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Real productivity isn’t about <strong>adding</strong> more tasks.</p>
<p>It’s about:<br>
✔ <strong>Eliminating distractions.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Cutting useless work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Focusing on what actually moves the needle.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I flipped my mindset:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-stop-optimizing-the-unimportant"><strong>1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant</strong></h3>
<p>I used to spend <strong>hours</strong> tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.</p>
<p>It felt productive, but in reality? <strong>It was just procrastination in disguise.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does this task even matter?</em></li>
<li><em>Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, the best way to <strong>be more productive</strong> is to <strong>stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-8020-focus-shift"><strong>2. The 80/20 Focus Shift</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Pareto Principle</strong> says <strong>80% of results come from 20% of effort.</strong></p>
<p>But most of us spend time on the <strong>80% of tasks</strong> that don’t actually move the needle.</p>
<p>So instead of asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I ask:<br>
✔ <em>What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?</em><br>
✔ <em>What can I cut without any real consequence?</em></p>
<p>Then, I <strong>ruthlessly</strong> focus on the <strong>high-impact 20%</strong>—and let go of the rest.</p>
<p>This was a game-changer for me. It’s not about <strong>doing everything</strong>. It’s about doing <strong>the right things.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-single-tasking-the-real-superpower"><strong>3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower</strong></h3>
<p>I used to <strong>pride myself on multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>But <strong>multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.</strong></p>
<p>It’s just rapidly <strong>switching between tasks</strong>, losing focus each time.</p>
<p>Now, I do the opposite:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>One tab at a time.</strong> No distractions.<br>
✔ <strong>One task at a time.</strong> Full focus, deep work.<br>
✔ <strong>One decision at a time.</strong> No jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>It <strong>feels</strong> slower, but in reality? <strong>It’s 10x more effective.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-the-do-less-but-better-rule"><strong>4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>Most people try to do everything <strong>at 70% effort.</strong></p>
<p>They spread themselves too thin, and their work <strong>suffers.</strong></p>
<p>But the real magic happens when you:</p>
<p>✔ Do <strong>fewer</strong> things, but do them <strong>exceptionally well.</strong><br>
✔ Say <strong>no</strong> to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.<br>
✔ Focus on <strong>quality over quantity.</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, by <strong>doing less, you achieve more.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway-stop-measuring-productivity-by-output"><strong>The Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest shift I made?</p>
<p>I stopped measuring productivity by <strong>how much I do.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, I measure it by:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>How much progress I make on things that actually matter.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much energy I have left at the end of the day.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.</strong></p>
<p>I stopped asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And started asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How can I do less, but better?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="if-youre-feeling-stuck-try-this"><strong>If You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This</strong></h2>
<p>If you’ve been <strong>optimizing, planning, and working harder</strong>—but still feel stuck?</p>
<p>Try the <strong>opposite.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Instead of doing more, <strong>do less—strategically.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of working harder, <strong>work on the right things.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, <strong>chase clarity.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>the most productive people</strong> aren’t the ones who get the most done.</p>
<p>They’re the ones who <strong>do what matters—and ignore everything else.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the secret.</p>
<p>It’s not about <strong>doing more.</strong><br>
It’s about <strong>doing less—but doing it better.</strong></p>

      <title>I Never Thought I’d Grow a Beard (But Here We Are)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/i-never-thought-id-grow-a-beard/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>Growing a beard was never in my plans. But this accidental experiment taught me more about identity than I expected.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been a <strong>beard guy.</strong></p>
<p>For most of my life, I thought of facial hair as something that just <strong>happened</strong> to other people—like an automatic feature that unlocked at a certain age. I’d see guys with <strong>thick, full beards</strong> and think, <em>Yeah, that’s just not for me.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t even a conscious decision. It was more like an unspoken agreement with myself:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I shave because I always have.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>I’m just not a beard person.</strong></p>
<p>And then, one day&hellip; <strong>I didn’t shave.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-accidental-beard-experiment"><strong>The Accidental Beard Experiment</strong></h2>
<p>I didn’t wake up one morning and decide, <em>I shall grow a beard!</em></p>
<p>It started with a few skipped shaves. Life got busy. I got lazy. And before I knew it, my face had <strong>more stubble than usual.</strong></p>
<p>Normally, this would have <strong>annoyed me.</strong> But this time?</p>
<p>I let it stay.</p>
<p>At first, it felt weird—like my <strong>own face was betraying me.</strong> I&rsquo;d catch glimpses of myself and think, <em>Who is this guy?</em></p>
<p>The <strong>itchy phase</strong> was real.<br>
The <strong>awkward patchy phase</strong> was even more real.</p>
<p>But the strangest part?</p>
<p>I <strong>kind of liked it.</strong></p>
<p>I started noticing little things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It made me <strong>look older</strong> (or maybe just <em>different</em>).</li>
<li>It <strong>changed the shape of my face.</strong></li>
<li>I kept catching myself <strong>stroking my chin like some kind of wise philosopher.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And the itch? It wasn’t as bad as I thought. More like a <strong>reminder</strong> that something was changing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-growing-a-beard-felt-so-different"><strong>Why Growing a Beard Felt So… Different</strong></h2>
<p>It’s funny how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can change the way you see yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I looked different.</strong> My face had more definition. My jawline felt stronger. It was like a <strong>real-life Instagram filter.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I felt different.</strong> There was something about it—maybe confidence, maybe curiosity—that made me feel more <strong>deliberate.</strong> Like I had <em>made a choice</em>, even if that choice was just to&hellip; not shave.</li>
<li><strong>Other people noticed.</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Oh, you’re growing it out?&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Hey, that actually suits you.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;You look… more Italian now.&rdquo;</em> (<em>That one made me laugh.</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wasn’t prepared for how much <strong>other people</strong> would comment on it. It was like I had <strong>changed something huge</strong>, when all I did was&hellip; <em>nothing.</em></p>
<p>And every time someone mentioned it, I felt this weird mix of <strong>pride and discomfort.</strong> Like I was being <strong>seen in a new way</strong>—and I wasn’t sure how I felt about that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-from-letting-my-face-do-its-thing"><strong>What I Learned From Letting My Face Do Its Thing</strong></h2>
<p>Growing a beard <strong>didn’t change my life.</strong></p>
<p>But it did make me <strong>realize something important.</strong></p>
<p>So many of the things we believe about ourselves—our <strong>“defaults”</strong>—aren’t actually rules. They’re just <strong>habits.</strong></p>
<p>For years, I thought:<br>
✔ <em>I’m a clean-shaven guy.</em><br>
✔ <em>Beards don’t suit me.</em><br>
✔ <em>This is just how I look.</em></p>
<p>And then, in a matter of weeks, those “truths” <strong>disappeared.</strong></p>
<p>It made me wonder:<br>
<em>How many other things do I believe about myself just because they’ve always been that way?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I’m not a morning person.</strong> (<em>Or am I just used to staying up late?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I don’t like public speaking.</strong> (<em>Or have I just never given it a real chance?</em>)</li>
<li><strong>I’m not a beard guy.</strong> (<em>Or did I just never let it grow long enough to find out?</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s strange how something as simple as <strong>not shaving</strong> can make you question so much more.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="will-i-keep-it"><strong>Will I Keep It?</strong></h2>
<p>I don’t know yet. Maybe I’ll <strong>shave it off next week.</strong><br>
Maybe I’ll <strong>keep it longer.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I’m just <strong>letting it be.</strong></p>
<p>No expectations. No rules. Just <strong>curiosity.</strong></p>
<p>But either way, this isn’t really about the beard.</p>
<p>It’s about realizing that sometimes, <strong>the smallest change can make you see yourself in a whole new way.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>That’s worth exploring.</strong></p>

      <description>Digital tools are powerful, but when it comes to problem-solving, nothing beats paper. Here’s why I, a programmer, still use analog methods.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-i-a-programmer-still-use-paper-like-its-1999"><strong>Why I, a Programmer, Still Use Paper Like It’s 1999</strong></h1>
<p>I spend my entire day in front of a screen—writing code, debugging, fixing issues. Everything I do is digital.</p>
<p>And yet, whenever I need to <strong>truly think</strong>, whenever I need to <strong>solve a problem</strong>, I reach for something ancient.</p>
<p><strong>Paper.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, real, dead-tree, old-school <strong>paper</strong>. With an <strong>actual pen.</strong> No stylus, no tablet. Just ink and a blank page.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-do-i-do-this"><strong>Why Do I Do This?</strong></h2>
<p>People at my last job called me old-school. Some thought I was joking.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You’re a programmer, why aren’t you using Notion, Obsidian, or some mind-mapping software?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I tried. I really did. I tested every digital tool that promised to boost creativity, enhance focus, or revolutionize note-taking.</p>
<p>But every time I brainstormed digitally, my brain didn’t work the same way.</p>
<p>With paper, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Think freely</strong> without clicking, scrolling, or being distracted by notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Draw connections</strong> with arrows, circles, and messy scribbles that no app can replicate.</li>
<li><strong>Physically slow down</strong>, which somehow speeds up my problem-solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t use paper because I’m nostalgic. I use it because <strong>it works.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-digital-thinking"><strong>The Problem with Digital Thinking</strong></h2>
<p>I love automation. I love shortcuts. I love anything that makes life easier. But when it comes to deep thinking, digital tools have a fatal flaw:</p>
<p>They make <strong>everything too neat.</strong></p>
<p>Typing forces you into a <strong>linear thought process</strong>. You write in straight lines, format as you go, and delete mistakes like they never happened.</p>
<p>But real problem-solving? <strong>It’s messy.</strong></p>
<p>It’s half-written thoughts, sketches, crossed-out ideas, and a page that looks like a conspiracy board before you finally crack the solution.</p>
<p>Digital tools force me into boxes—literally and figuratively. I can’t draw wild arrows connecting random ideas. I can’t scribble thoughts in the margin and come back to them later.</p>
<p>When I write on paper, I’m <strong>not editing as I think.</strong> I’m letting ideas <strong>collide</strong>, not organizing them prematurely. And that’s exactly what I need to get to the right answer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="paper-is-my-debugging-tool"><strong>Paper is My Debugging Tool</strong></h2>
<p>For some people, thinking happens <strong>on the keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>For me, thinking happens <strong>with a pen.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just about notes—it’s about <strong>clarity</strong>. It’s about <strong>processing</strong>. It’s about slowing down just enough to let my brain catch up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before I write code, I write on paper.</strong> I map out the logic, draw flowcharts, and outline the structure. By the time I open my editor, I already know the architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Before I solve a bug, I sketch it out.</strong> I diagram the data flow, mark potential breakpoints, and circle points of failure. Seeing it visually helps me understand it faster.</li>
<li><strong>Before I commit to an approach, I let my brain wander on an actual page.</strong> I list pros and cons, explore alternative solutions, and play out scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the time I finally touch the keyboard, <strong>I already know what I’m doing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>People assume that because we work in tech, we should do everything with tech. But sometimes, the best tool for the job <strong>isn’t the newest or the most advanced</strong>—it’s just the one that works.</p>
<p>No productivity hack replaces <strong>thinking</strong>.<br>
No app mimics <strong>messy creativity</strong>.<br>
No digital shortcut matches the simplicity of pen and paper.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’ll keep using paper. Call me old-school. Call me weird.</p>
<p>But also? <strong>Watch me solve problems faster than you.</strong></p>
<p>Because in a world obsessed with digital productivity, sometimes the real secret weapon is the analog one.</p>

      <title>The Never-Ending Search for the Perfect App: Why I Can’t Stop Downloading</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/never-ending-search-for-the-perfect-app/</link>

      <description>Obsessed with finding the perfect app? You’re not alone. Join me on my endless quest for the ultimate productivity tools.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people spend their free time <strong>watching movies, playing games, or reading books</strong>.<br>
I spend mine on an endless, slightly obsessive search for <strong>the perfect app.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what it is—<strong>file manager, calendar, task manager, note-taking app</strong>—if I use it daily, I want it to be <em>just right</em>.</p>
<p>But here’s the problem: <strong>it never is.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-app-store-illusion"><strong>The App Store Illusion</strong></h2>
<p>It always starts the same way.</p>
<p>I convince myself that somewhere, hidden among a sea of <strong>mediocre software</strong>, <strong>the perfect app exists</strong>.</p>
<p>So I start searching.<br>
Reading reviews.<br>
Watching <strong>YouTube comparisons at 2x speed</strong>.<br>
Checking <strong>Reddit threads full of people just like me</strong>—people who have fallen down the same rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I get lost in endless lists like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Top 10 Productivity Apps You Need.”</em></li>
<li><em>“Best File Managers for Windows and iPhone.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, I find something <strong>promising</strong>.</p>
<p>I download it, open it, start setting it up… and then the realization hits:</p>
<p><strong>Something is off.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The interface is <em>almost</em> perfect, but there’s <strong>one weird design choice</strong> that drives me insane.</li>
<li>The features are great, but <strong>why is there a subscription for this?</strong></li>
<li>It’s perfect on <strong>iPhone</strong>, but the <strong>Windows version looks like it was built in 2009</strong> and abandoned.</li>
<li>It’s perfect on <strong>Windows</strong>, but the <strong>iPhone version syncs once every full moon</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And just like that, <strong>the cycle continues</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-do-i-do-this-to-myself"><strong>Why Do I Do This to Myself?</strong></h2>
<p>I know what you’re thinking:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Why not just pick one and move on?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Because that’s what <strong>normal people</strong> do. But my brain <strong>doesn’t work that way</strong>.</p>
<p>I need <strong>flow</strong> in my tools. If I open an app and something feels <strong>even slightly frustrating</strong>, it’s like an <strong>itch I can’t scratch</strong>.<br>
I’ll notice it <strong>every time</strong> I use it. And once I notice it? I <strong>can’t un-notice it</strong>.</p>
<p>I have a <strong>zero-tolerance policy</strong> for inefficiency:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>If an app takes more than two clicks</strong> to do something that should take one, it’s dead to me.<br>
✔ <strong>If it’s ugly</strong> or the design is inconsistent, I won’t use it, <strong>no matter how powerful it is</strong>.<br>
✔ <strong>If it’s perfect but has a monthly subscription,</strong> I will uninstall it <strong>on principle</strong>.</p>
<p>I want my apps to feel <strong>invisible</strong>, like they don’t exist. They should <strong>just work</strong> without reminding me they’re there.</p>
<p>The worst part?</p>
<p>The apps I abandoned <strong>months ago</strong>?<br>
Sometimes, I <strong>go back</strong>, thinking,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Maybe they fixed it. Maybe it wasn’t so bad.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It was.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-windows-vs-iphone-struggle"><strong>The Windows vs. iPhone Struggle</strong></h2>
<p>If you’re an Apple user, you know that <strong>Apple apps just work together</strong>.<br>
But try finding an app that <strong>works flawlessly on both Windows and iPhone?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good luck.</strong></p>
<p>I live in <strong>two worlds</strong>:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Windows for work.</strong> It’s where I <strong>code, debug, and spend most of my day</strong>.<br>
✔ <strong>iPhone for personal life.</strong> It’s where I <strong>organize tasks, take notes, and communicate</strong>.</p>
<p>You’d think by now, in 2024, we’d have <strong>seamless cross-platform apps that work beautifully everywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone apps</strong> are <strong>beautiful</strong>, but their <strong>Windows counterparts</strong> feel like <strong>afterthoughts</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Windows apps</strong> are <strong>powerful</strong>, but most of them were <strong>designed by people who hate UI</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The “cross-platform” apps?</strong> Usually the <strong>worst of both worlds</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought switching to <strong>Android</strong> would solve this.</p>
<p>It didn’t.</p>
<p>It just gave me <strong>different</strong> problems.</p>
<p>I’ve even considered switching <strong>everything to Apple</strong>, but the thought of using <strong>macOS for development</strong> makes me break out in <strong>hives</strong>.<br>
I like my <strong>hardware customizable</strong> and my <strong>software open</strong>, thank you very much.</p>
<p>So I keep searching, hoping that <strong>one day, the perfect ecosystem will exist</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-inevitable-conclusion"><strong>The Inevitable Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, I’ve <strong>accepted my fate</strong>.</p>
<p>I will <strong>never</strong> settle.</p>
<p>I will always <strong>tweak, test, uninstall, reinstall, and repeat</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will keep <strong>switching between One Commander and Total Commander</strong> because <strong>each is 90% perfect but missing one crucial feature</strong>.</li>
<li>I will keep <strong>trying every new calendar app</strong> that promises to <strong>revolutionize scheduling</strong>, only to <strong>go back to Google Calendar</strong>.</li>
<li>I will keep hoping that <strong>one day, Fantastical will magically become cross-platform</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe <strong>there is no perfect app</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem <strong>isn’t the apps—it’s me</strong>.</p>
<p>But until someone creates a:<br>
✔ <strong>Seamless</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Beautiful</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Feature-packed</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Cross-platform</strong><br>
✔ <strong>One-time-payment</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Ad-free</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Non-subscription</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Perfectly intuitive app for every function I need</strong>…</p>
<p>I’ll be here.<br>
<strong>Searching. Comparing. Complaining.</strong></p>
<p>And then <strong>downloading another one</strong>.</p>

      <title>The Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything</title>

      <description>Minimalism taken to the next level—finding the one perfect item for everything. Discover my quest for ultimate efficiency and portability.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-pursuit-of-the-perfect-my-quest-for-the-ultimate-everything"><strong>The Pursuit of the Perfect: My Quest for the Ultimate Everything</strong></h1>
<p>Most people <strong>collect things</strong>. I <strong>eliminate them</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m not just talking about decluttering. I mean a full-scale <strong>mission to find the absolute best</strong>—the <strong>one</strong> perfect item in every category—so I never have to think about it again.</p>
<p>✔ One <strong>backpack.</strong><br>
✔ One <strong>pen.</strong><br>
✔ One <strong>pencil.</strong><br>
✔ One <strong>bathroom set.</strong></p>
<p>Everything I own must be <strong>the best, the most compact, the most portable.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Because life is unpredictable. One day you’re settled, the next, you’re packing your life into a suitcase. And when that happens, you start looking at your things differently.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Not as objects, but as decisions.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want five backpacks—I want <strong>one that does it all</strong>.<br>
I don’t want a drawer full of pens—I want <strong>one that feels perfect in my hand</strong>.<br>
I don’t want a cluttered bathroom—I want <strong>one streamlined setup that works anywhere in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn’t just minimalism.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>ruthless optimization.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-rules-of-the-game"><strong>The Rules of the Game</strong></h2>
<p>Finding <strong>The One</strong> is an <strong>art form</strong>. It’s not about luxury, trends, or whatever the internet says is cool. It’s about <strong>functionality, durability, and pure problem-solving.</strong></p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>Compactness is king.</strong> If it’s too bulky, it’s out. <strong>Portability without sacrifice.</strong><br>
2️⃣ <strong>One item, zero regrets.</strong> Once I pick The One, I’m committed. No backups, no alternatives. <strong>This is my Excalibur.</strong><br>
3️⃣ <strong>Quality over everything.</strong> If it doesn’t last, it doesn’t belong. <strong>No disposable junk.</strong><br>
4️⃣ <strong>No over-engineered nonsense.</strong> If a backpack has 72 hidden compartments, a built-in solar panel, and an AI-powered zipper, I <strong>don’t want it</strong>. Keep it <strong>simple, durable, and effective.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t about <strong>being cheap</strong>. It’s about <strong>investing in the best, once</strong>—and then <strong>never thinking about it again.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-search-is-brutal"><strong>The Search is Brutal</strong></h2>
<p>You’d think this would be easy. It’s not.</p>
<p>Finding the <strong>one</strong> perfect item in any category means sifting through <strong>a sea of almost-perfect-but-not-quite-right</strong> options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The best backpack?</strong> Big enough for essentials, small enough for travel, structured but not rigid, lightweight but durable. <strong>After weeks of research, I find one. Then… a new contender appears. The cycle repeats.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The best pen?</strong> Writes smoothly, dries fast, feels premium but doesn’t scream <em>pretentious fountain pen guy</em>. <strong>Found it. But wait—should I test one more?</strong></li>
<li><strong>The best toothbrush?</strong> Yes, even <strong>this</strong> is a debate. Compact, electric, but without needing a suitcase full of accessories. <strong>Why is this so hard?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each decision is a <strong>battle</strong>. A <strong>war between function and obsession.</strong></p>
<p>And the internet doesn’t make it easier. Every time I think I’ve found The One, I read one more review that plants a seed of doubt.</p>
<p>❌ <em>“This backpack is perfect… but the zipper is flimsy.”</em><br>
❌ <em>“This pen is incredible… but it smudges if you’re left-handed.”</em><br>
❌ <em>“This toothbrush is great… but it needs a proprietary charger the size of a brick.”</em></p>
<p>I fall down rabbit holes. I read Reddit threads, watch YouTube comparisons, and make <strong>spreadsheets</strong> with pros and cons.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m <strong>that person.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-i-love-this-insanity"><strong>Why I Love This Insanity</strong></h2>
<p>Some people call it <strong>overthinking</strong>.</p>
<p>I call it <strong>engineering my life for efficiency.</strong></p>
<p>Because once I’ve chosen <strong>The One</strong>, <strong>I’m free.</strong></p>
<p>✅ No more switching.<br>
✅ No more rebuying.<br>
✅ No more second-guessing.</p>
<p>Just <strong>one backpack, one pen, one perfect setup.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about <strong>reducing decision fatigue</strong>. It’s about <strong>knowing that every item I own is the absolute best choice for me</strong>. It’s about <strong>portability, mobility, and adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s also about <strong>being prepared</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve moved across continents <strong>multiple times</strong>. I know what it’s like to pack your life into a suitcase. I know the <strong>freedom of traveling light</strong> and the <strong>nightmare of clutter</strong>.</p>
<p>So when the <strong>next big move</strong> happens—whether across a city or across a continent—I’ll be ready.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>No clutter.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>No baggage.</strong><br>
✅ <strong>Just the best, most compact version of everything I need.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-final-boss-battle-of-minimalism"><strong>The Final Boss Battle of Minimalism</strong></h2>
<p>I’m not naive.</p>
<p>I know <strong>The One</strong> doesn’t really exist. There’s always something new, always a better version coming out.</p>
<p>But the pursuit isn’t just about the object—it’s about <strong>the mindset.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about <strong>curating my life</strong> to be as <strong>efficient and effective as possible</strong>. It’s about <strong>choosing quality over quantity</strong> in every decision.</p>
<p>So if you ever see me staring at a backpack in deep existential thought… just know I’m in the <strong>final boss battle of minimalism</strong>.</p>
<p>And when I finally find <strong>The One</strong>?</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I’ll stop looking.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Until the next perfect version comes out.</strong> 😉</p>

      <title>How I Outsmart My Own Brain to Get Things Done</title>

      <description>Life feels like an action movie with no pause button. Here&amp;#39;s how I handle the chaos and still get things done.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My brain works like an <strong>action movie with no pause button</strong>. <strong>No clear story, no control</strong>, and just when things start to make sense—BAM! <strong>A sudden cut to something completely different.</strong></p>
<p>One moment, I’m focused, working hard. The next?</p>
<p>Oh wow, <strong>did you know ancient Romans made concrete</strong> that still exists today?<br>
Wait, wasn’t I supposed to answer an email?<br>
Oh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let me check&hellip;<br>
Wait. <strong>What was I doing?</strong></p>
<p>And just like that, 30 minutes disappear. I’m holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of <strong>a completely different task</strong> than the one I started.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-productivity-toolbox-everything-i-tried-and-why-it-didnt-work"><strong>The Productivity Toolbox: Everything I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work)</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve tested <strong>every productivity method</strong> I could find.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-it Notes?</strong> Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board.</li>
<li><strong>Timers?</strong> Useful—if I remember I set them.</li>
<li><strong>To-do lists?</strong> I write them, I admire them&hellip; I never check them again.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity apps?</strong> I <strong>collect them like Pokémon.</strong> I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? <strong>None work if I forget to open them.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pomodoro?</strong> Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve heard all the usual advice:<br>
<em>&ldquo;Just choose your priorities!&rdquo;</em> But <strong>everything</strong> feels important.<br>
<em>&ldquo;Use reminders!&rdquo;</em> Great idea—if I remember to set them.<br>
<em>&ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?&rdquo;</em> Yes. I lost track of them too.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t try. I do. But <strong>my brain doesn’t follow the rules.</strong></p>
<p>And yet… <strong>I still get things done.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-i-actually-get-work-done"><strong>How I Actually Get Work Done</strong></h2>
<p>I stopped looking for <strong>one perfect system</strong>—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of <strong>simple tricks and mental hacks</strong> to keep myself productive.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One task at a time.</strong> Multitasking? <strong>I quit that.</strong> If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing <strong>nothing</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Writing everything down.</strong> My memory is unreliable, so I put <strong>everything</strong> in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it.</li>
<li><strong>The Two-Minute Rule.</strong> If something takes <strong>less than two minutes</strong>, I do it <strong>right away</strong>. Otherwise, it disappears into <em>“I’ll do it later”</em> (which means never).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple timers.</strong> Since I forget I set a timer, I use <strong>two or three different ones</strong>. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer!</li>
<li><strong>Using my deep focus.</strong> When my brain decides something is <strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD</strong>, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the most important thing?</p>
<h3 id="i-work-with-my-brain-not-against-it"><strong>I Work With My Brain, Not Against It</strong></h3>
<p>I stopped trying to use <strong>systems made for other people</strong>. I can’t <strong>force</strong> focus, but I can <strong>catch it</strong> when it happens.</p>
<p>If I suddenly get <strong>super focused</strong> on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I <strong>write them all down</strong> and organize them later.</p>
<p>My productivity is not <strong>straightforward</strong>. <strong>It moves in all directions.</strong> And that’s okay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-tools-that-sometimes-help"><strong>The Tools That (Sometimes) Help</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notion:</strong> My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion.</li>
<li><strong>Post-it Notes:</strong> Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Timers (Lots of Them):</strong> On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. <em>At least one might help me.</em></li>
<li><strong>Single-tasking mode:</strong> <strong>One window. One tab. One job.</strong> If I open a second tab, it means <strong>I need to do it later.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Solid Starts:</strong> Yes, even for feeding my son. Because <strong>focus problems don’t take a break</strong> when you’re a parent.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, my brain is <strong>chaotic</strong>. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have <strong>a small collection of abandoned productivity tools</strong>.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day? <strong>I get things done.</strong></p>
<p>Not in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in <strong>my way.</strong></p>
<p>Because sometimes, <strong>thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.</strong></p>
<p>So if you ever see me <strong>staring at the screen</strong>, just know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I might be solving a <strong>complicated problem</strong>&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, <strong>I’ll figure it out.</strong></p>

      <title>Why We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)</title>

      <description>Change isn&amp;#39;t about willpower—it&amp;#39;s about identity. Discover why habits fail and how shifting your identity leads to lasting change.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-we-struggle-to-change-and-the-simple-fix-that-works"><strong>Why We Struggle to Change (And the Simple Fix That Works)</strong></h1>
<p>I used to think change was about willpower.</p>
<p>If I wanted to exercise more, eat better, focus longer, or wake up earlier, I just had to try harder. Push through resistance. Be disciplined.</p>
<p>I told myself, <em>“Just do it. No excuses.”</em></p>
<p>And for a while, it worked. I’d wake up early, go to the gym, power through tasks, and feel like I was finally winning at life.</p>
<p>But then, inevitably, I’d slip. One skipped workout. One late night. One missed deadline.</p>
<p>And every time I failed, I didn’t just feel unmotivated—I felt stuck. Like I just wasn’t the type of person who could stick to things.</p>
<p>Then I learned something that changed everything:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t fail because we’re lazy. We fail because we rely on willpower instead of identity.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why"><strong>Why &ldquo;Trying Harder&rdquo; Never Works</strong></h2>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<p>Two people are offered a cigarette.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first person says, <em>“No thanks, I’m trying to quit.”</em></li>
<li>The second person says, <em>“No thanks, I don’t smoke.”</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first still sees themselves as a smoker fighting temptation. The second has already rewritten their identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first person is using willpower—constantly resisting.</li>
<li>The second person doesn’t need willpower because their identity has shifted.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s why most habits fail.</p>
<p>We focus on changing actions instead of changing who we are.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-identity-based-approach-to-change"><strong>The Identity-Based Approach to Change</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of relying on motivation or discipline, I started shifting my identity first.</p>
<p>Every action we take is a vote for the type of person we want to become.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I show up at the gym, I’m casting votes for becoming a fit person.</li>
<li>If I write consistently, I’m becoming a writer.</li>
<li>If I procrastinate, I’m reinforcing the identity of someone who avoids challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to stop seeing habits as things I <em>do</em> and start seeing them as things that define who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-im-rewiring-my-brain-for-lasting-change"><strong>How I’m Rewiring My Brain for Lasting Change</strong></h2>
<p>I started with small identity shifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of <em>“I should exercise more,”</em> I tell myself <em>“I’m the kind of person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to focus better,”</em> I remind myself <em>“I’m someone who works with deep focus.”</em></li>
<li>Instead of <em>“I need to stop procrastinating,”</em> I say <em>“I’m the type of person who takes action immediately.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At first, it felt fake. But here’s the key:</p>
<p><strong>The brain hates cognitive dissonance.</strong></p>
<p>When you tell yourself you <em>are</em> something, you subconsciously start acting like it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I tell myself I’m someone who moves every day, it feels wrong to sit on the couch all day.</li>
<li>If I see myself as a deep worker, it feels unnatural to check my phone every five minutes.</li>
<li>If I’m the type of person who takes action immediately, procrastination feels out of character.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not about forcing myself to change. It’s about making the new behavior feel like who I am.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-trying-and-being"><strong>The Difference Between Trying and Being</strong></h2>
<p>I used to say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m trying to exercise more.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to focus better.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m trying to wake up earlier.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now I say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m a person who moves every day.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m someone who works with focus.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m the kind of person who gets up early.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The first set is about effort. The second set is about identity.</p>
<p>And identity is powerful. It sticks. It changes how you see yourself. And how you see yourself changes your actions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Willpower is unreliable.<br>
Motivation fades.<br>
But identity sticks.</p>
<p>If you want to change something, don’t start with what you do.<br>
Start with who you are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to read more? Become a reader.</li>
<li>Want to be healthier? Become the kind of person who prioritizes health.</li>
<li>Want to write more? Become a writer, even before you’re “good” at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the truth is:</p>
<p><strong>We don’t act consistently with our goals. We act consistently with our identity.</strong></p>
<p>Change who you are, and the actions will follow.</p>

      <title>The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck</title>

      <description>Motivation is a lie. Discover why waiting to feel inspired keeps you stuck and learn practical strategies to take action anyway.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-motivation-myth-why-waiting-to-feel-inspired-will-keep-you-stuck"><strong>The Motivation Myth: Why Waiting to Feel Inspired Will Keep You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I waited for <strong>motivation to strike</strong>.</p>
<p>I thought <strong>productive people</strong> had some kind of <strong>magical drive</strong> I didn’t.<br>
That one day, I’d wake up <strong>full of energy</strong>, ready to become the kind of person who exercises, writes consistently, or tackles big projects <strong>without procrastinating</strong>.</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>That day <strong>never came.</strong></p>
<p>And it never <em>will.</em></p>
<p>Because here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-lie"><strong>Motivation is a lie.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-motivation-doesnt-matter"><strong>Why Motivation Doesn’t Matter</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve all said it:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“I just need to get motivated.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’ll start when I feel ready.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I don’t have the energy today.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But <strong>motivation isn’t something you <em>have</em>—it’s something you <em>create.</em></strong></p>
<p>We think <strong>action comes after motivation</strong>, when really, it’s the other way around.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-follows-action-not-the-other-way-around"><strong>Motivation follows action, not the other way around.</strong></h3>
<p>You don’t <strong>wait to feel inspired</strong> before starting.<br>
You start, and then <strong>inspiration finds you.</strong></p>
<p>Once I figured this out, <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<p>I used to wait for that <strong>perfect wave of motivation</strong>—but that feeling was rare, and when it did show up, it didn’t last.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something:</p>
<h3 id="i-always-felt-more-motivated-after-i-started-not-before"><strong>I always felt more motivated after I started, not before.</strong></h3>
<p>Even if I <em>didn’t feel like it</em>—once I got moving, I wanted to keep going.<br>
That’s when I realized:</p>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-side-effect-of-action"><strong>Motivation is a side effect of action.</strong></h3>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-actually-works-and-why-its-so-simple"><strong>What Actually Works (And Why It’s So Simple)</strong></h2>
<p>If I waited to <em>feel</em> motivated, I’d never do anything.</p>
<p>So instead, I follow <strong>three simple rules</strong> that make action inevitable:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-the-5-minute-rule"><strong>1. The 5-Minute Rule</strong></h3>
<p>If something feels overwhelming, I <strong>trick my brain</strong> by saying:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>I’ll just do it for five minutes.</strong> That’s it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too tired to work out?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of exercise.</em></li>
<li><strong>Don’t want to start that project?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of brainstorming.</em></li>
<li><strong>Can’t focus on writing?</strong> → <em>Five minutes of bad first drafts.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>90% of the time, I keep going.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>starting is the hardest part.</strong> Once I’m in motion, <strong>momentum keeps me moving.</strong></p>
<p>And if I really <strong>do stop after five minutes?</strong><br>
At least I did <em>something</em>—and something is infinitely <strong>better than nothing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-no-emotion-rule"><strong>2. The “No Emotion” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>I stopped asking myself <strong>if I <em>felt</em> like doing something.</strong></p>
<p>Feelings are unreliable. If I waited until I “felt like it,” I’d <strong>never get anything done.</strong></p>
<p>So I stopped negotiating with myself.</p>
<p>Now, I treat actions like brushing my teeth. <strong>No debates. No negotiations.</strong><br>
It’s just <strong>what I do.</strong></p>
<p>✔ <strong>Exercise?</strong> → <em>It’s not about motivation. It’s just “time to move.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Writing?</strong> → <em>Not about inspiration. It’s just “time to write.”</em><br>
✔ <strong>Starting work?</strong> → <em>Not about being ready. It’s just “time to begin.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Action first. Feelings later.</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly, <strong>once I start, motivation usually shows up.</strong></p>
<p>And if it doesn’t? <strong>Who cares? I’m already doing the thing.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-3-choice-trick"><strong>3. The 3-Choice Trick</strong></h3>
<p>When I don’t want to do something, I <strong>limit my options</strong> to just three:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>Do it now.</strong> (<em>Just start, even if it’s imperfect.</em>)<br>
2️⃣ <strong>Do it badly.</strong> (<em>Perfectionism kills momentum. Done is better than perfect.</em>)<br>
3️⃣ <strong>Do nothing—but sit there and stare at the wall.</strong></p>
<p>Turns out, <strong>staring at a wall is boring.</strong> So I usually just do the thing.</p>
<p>This trick works because it eliminates <strong>all distractions</strong>.<br>
I’m not allowed to <strong>scroll on my phone</strong> or <strong>check social media</strong>.</p>
<p>My only choices?<br>
✔ <strong>Work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Do it badly.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Or sit there doing absolutely nothing.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>Working or doing it badly is always better than the existential void of wall-staring.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-this-works-the-science-of-momentum"><strong>Why This Works: The Science of Momentum</strong></h2>
<p>Newton’s First Law of Motion states:</p>
<h3 id="an-object-at-rest-stays-at-rest-and-an-object-in-motion-stays-in-motion"><strong>“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.”</strong></h3>
<p>Turns out, <strong>this applies to humans too.</strong></p>
<p>When we’re at rest (<strong>not doing the thing</strong>), it feels <strong>impossible to get moving</strong>.<br>
But <strong>once we start</strong>, it’s <strong>easier to keep going.</strong></p>
<p>This is why the hardest part of any task is <strong>getting started.</strong><br>
It’s why the <strong>5-minute rule works so well</strong>.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>It breaks the inertia.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It removes overthinking.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>It makes starting feel effortless.</strong></p>
<p>And once you’re moving? <strong>Momentum takes over.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about willpower.<br>
It’s about <strong>tricking your brain into motion.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<h3 id="motivation-is-a-trap-its-not-coming-to-save-you"><strong>Motivation is a trap.</strong> It’s not coming to save you.</h3>
<p>If you wait to “feel like it,” you’ll wait forever.<br>
If you wait until you’re “ready,” you’ll never start.</p>
<p>But action? <strong>Action leads to momentum.</strong><br>
And <strong>momentum creates motivation.</strong></p>
<p>So next time you’re waiting to “feel ready,” don’t.</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Start for five minutes.</strong> (<em>Even if it’s terrible.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Do it without debating.</strong> (<em>Feelings can catch up later.</em>)<br>
✔ <strong>Give yourself only three choices.</strong> (<em>Work, do it badly, or stare at the wall.</em>)</p>
<p>Because once you start, you <em>won’t</em> stop.</p>
<p>And when you stop needing motivation to begin, <strong>you’ll get more done than ever before.</strong></p>

      <title>Why Changing Your Mind is a Sign of Intelligence, Not Weakness</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-changing-your-mind-is-a-sign-of-intelligence/</guid>
      <description>Changing your mind isn’t a weakness—it’s growth. Discover why evolving your perspective makes you smarter and more adaptable.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people think <strong>changing your mind is a weakness</strong>—that once you take a stance, you have to defend it forever. That <strong>certainty equals strength</strong> and doubt makes you unreliable.</p>
<p>I <strong>completely disagree.</strong></p>
<p>I change my mind <strong>all the time.</strong> Not because I’m indecisive, but because <strong>I’m learning.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-art-of-arguing-with-yourself"><strong>The Art of Arguing With Yourself</strong></h2>
<p>It’s easy to believe your opinion is right. After all, <strong>your brain worked hard to form it.</strong></p>
<p>And then, suddenly&hellip; doubt creeps in.</p>
<p>You start thinking about the <strong>opposite perspective.</strong> You challenge your own logic. You realize, <em>maybe I was missing something.</em></p>
<p>Some people panic when this happens. They think it means they were wrong. They feel embarrassed. Defensive. But I see it differently: <strong>every time I change my mind, I get closer to the truth.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve realized that my opinions are just <strong>snapshots</strong> of what I understood at the time. And like outdated software, they need <strong>updates.</strong></p>
<p>I constantly ask myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What if I’m wrong?</em></li>
<li><em>What am I not considering?</em></li>
<li><em>How would someone who disagrees with me see this?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I argue <strong>against my own beliefs</strong> to test their strength. I look for <strong>holes in my logic.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t being indecisive. <strong>This is debugging my own thinking.</strong></p>
<p>And every time I find a flaw, I fix it. <strong>I upgrade.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="marriage-the-ultimate-debate-club"><strong>Marriage: The Ultimate Debate Club</strong></h2>
<p>If you want practice in <strong>changing your mind</strong>, get married.</p>
<p>My wife and I <strong>love</strong> to debate. Not argue—debate.</p>
<p>It starts with small things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Is this really the best way to load the dishwasher?</em></li>
<li><em>Is a hot dog a sandwich?</em></li>
<li><em>Do we really need to rearrange the furniture again?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, two hours later, we’re deep into <strong>life, philosophy, and the meaning of everything.</strong></p>
<p>And sometimes, <strong>we completely switch sides.</strong></p>
<p>Not because one of us &ldquo;won.&rdquo;<br>
Not because we’re trying to be &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But because we actually <strong>listened</strong> to each other.</p>
<p>Because <strong>seeing the world through someone else’s eyes makes you smarter.</strong></p>
<p>And yes, sometimes, she’s right, and I have to admit I was wrong.<br>
(Okay, <strong>often</strong> she’s right, but that’s another story.)</p>
<p>But every time I admit I was wrong, <strong>I get smarter.</strong><br>
And every time she does, <strong>we both grow.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-changing-your-mind-is-a-superpower"><strong>Why Changing Your Mind is a Superpower</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s what I’ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you never change your mind, <strong>you’re not learning.</strong> You’re just repeating yourself.</li>
<li>Admitting you were wrong <strong>doesn’t make you weak.</strong> It makes you someone people actually trust.</li>
<li>The smartest people <strong>aren’t the ones who refuse to budge.</strong> They’re the ones who keep refining their ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<p>Every time you change your mind, it means <strong>you’ve learned something new.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Science evolves</strong> by questioning and updating its ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Great leaders</strong> adjust their strategies when new information comes in.</li>
<li><strong>Successful people</strong> don’t fear being wrong—they use it as a chance to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing your mind <strong>doesn’t mean you were stupid before.</strong><br>
It means you’re <strong>smarter now.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t mean you were wrong.<br>
It means <strong>you’ve improved.</strong></p>
<p>And over time? Your thinking gets closer and closer to something that actually resembles <strong>the truth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="version-20-and-beyond"><strong>Version 2.0 (And Beyond)</strong></h2>
<p>I used to think that changing my mind meant I was inconsistent.<br>
Now, I see it as <strong>a sign of growth.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to be <strong>version 1.0 of myself forever.</strong><br>
I want to be <strong>2.0, 3.0, 10.0</strong>—constantly upgrading, constantly improving.</p>
<p>Some people are <strong>proud of being &ldquo;consistent.&rdquo;</strong> But if you’re consistent <strong>just for the sake of consistency</strong>, you’re not growing—you’re stuck.</p>
<p>People who never change their minds? <strong>They’re frozen in time.</strong><br>
People who adapt, question, and rethink? <strong>They’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>And that means being willing to say,<br>
<em>&ldquo;I was wrong.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I learned something new.&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>&ldquo;I’ve updated my thinking.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It means embracing <strong>doubt, curiosity, and growth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>People think strength is about <strong>sticking to your guns no matter what.</strong><br>
But real strength? <strong>Real strength is knowing when to change your mind.</strong></p>
<p>It’s about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being <strong>curious</strong> enough to question yourself.</li>
<li>Being <strong>humble</strong> enough to admit when you’re wrong.</li>
<li>Being <strong>smart</strong> enough to see doubt as a tool for growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the next time someone accuses you of <strong>flip-flopping</strong>, don’t take it as an insult.<br>
Take it as <strong>proof that you’re evolving.</strong></p>
<p>Because the strongest minds?<br>
They’re the ones that <strong>never stop upgrading.</strong></p>

      <title>Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)</title>

      <description>We often think the past was better, but nostalgia tricks us. Discover why we romanticize the past and how to appreciate the present.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="why-we-romanticize-the-past-and-why-it-keeps-us-stuck"><strong>Why We Romanticize the Past (And Why It Keeps Us Stuck)</strong></h1>
<p>Ever caught yourself thinking, <em>“Things were better back then”</em>?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s childhood summers that seemed endless, music that just <em>felt</em> different, or the way life seemed simpler before everything became digital, fast, and exhausting.</p>
<p>I do this all the time.</p>
<p>I think about my years in Italy—the long walks, the fresh bread from the corner bakery, the feeling of time stretching endlessly.<br>
I remember the early days of the internet, when everything felt new, when logging off actually meant being <em>disconnected.</em></p>
<p>And then, reality hits me: <strong>the past wasn’t actually better. It just feels that way.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-nostalgia-filter-why-we-rewrite-our-own-history"><strong>The Nostalgia Filter: Why We Rewrite Our Own History</strong></h2>
<p>Our brains don’t store memories like a hard drive. They <strong>edit, distort, and reshape</strong> them over time. And they’re <em>really</em> good at two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Blurring the bad parts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We naturally forget the stress, the boredom, the awkward moments.</li>
<li>The brain smooths out the rough edges, leaving behind a highlight reel.</li>
<li>It’s why vacations seem perfect in hindsight—even though we spent half the time arguing over directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intensifying emotions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our best memories aren’t just stored; they’re amplified.</li>
<li>The sunsets were warmer, the music hit harder, and even the smallest moments felt <em>magical.</em></li>
<li>We remember how we <em>felt</em>, not necessarily how things <em>were.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why childhood feels dreamlike, why first loves seem impossible to recreate, and why people always say, <em>“They don’t make movies like they used to.”</em></p>
<p>It’s not that things were better. <strong>It’s that we experienced them differently.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-we-crave-the-past-and-how-it-tricks-us"><strong>Why We Crave the Past (And How It Tricks Us)</strong></h2>
<p>So why do we keep looking back?</p>
<p>Because nostalgia is <strong>a safe place</strong>—one where we already know how everything turns out.</p>
<p>And when the present feels overwhelming? Our brains do something sneaky:</p>
<p>They make the past feel <strong>simpler, warmer, and more certain</strong> than it actually was.</p>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ‘90s?</strong><br>
We remember the cartoons, not the dial-up internet and expensive long-distance calls.</li>
<li><strong>Childhood?</strong><br>
We remember the carefree summers, not the school stress and wanting to grow up faster.</li>
<li><strong>Early relationships?</strong><br>
We remember the butterflies, not the heartbreaks and confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I romanticize my years in Italy. I remember the sunsets over the Adriatic Sea, the long dinners, the laughter echoing in the streets.<br>
But I conveniently forget the struggles: the homesickness, the financial stress, the feeling of being an outsider.</p>
<p>My brain <strong>edited those parts out.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-double-edged-sword-of-nostalgia"><strong>The Double-Edged Sword of Nostalgia</strong></h2>
<p>Nostalgia isn’t inherently bad. It can be <strong>beautiful, comforting, and inspiring.</strong><br>
But it becomes dangerous when we start believing the edited version over the real one.</p>
<p>When we convince ourselves that the past was better, we <strong>rob the present of its potential.</strong></p>
<p>We start thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Things will never be as good as they were.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I was happier back then.”</em></li>
<li><em>“The world is worse now.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But was it really better?<br>
Or did we just experience it <strong>differently</strong>?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so"><strong>So&hellip; Should We Stop Romanticizing the Past?</strong></h2>
<p>Not at all. Nostalgia is <strong>a tool, not a trap—if we use it the right way.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I see it now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of chasing the past, I use it as a guide.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What made those times feel special?</li>
<li>Was it the slower pace? The deep conversations? The sense of adventure?</li>
<li>Maybe I need <em>more</em> of that in my life today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of seeing the past as “better,” I see it as a different chapter.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every stage of life has its own kind of magic—I just have to notice it.</li>
<li>If childhood was about wonder and discovery, maybe adulthood is about <strong>creation and purpose.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instead of comparing, I create.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The past didn’t have some secret ingredient that’s missing today.</li>
<li>The magic isn’t gone—it’s just waiting for me to make it again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Nostalgia isn’t a doorway back in time. It’s a <strong>mirror</strong>—one that shows us what we love, what we miss, and what we need to bring into the present.</p>
<p>It’s a reminder that the magic we felt back then didn’t come from the world being better.<br>
It came from <strong>how we experienced it.</strong></p>
<p>We were present. We were curious. We were open to wonder.</p>
<p>So next time you find yourself saying, <em>“Things were better back then”</em>, stop and ask:</p>
<p><em>Or maybe&hellip; I was just better at living in the moment?</em></p>
<p>Maybe the problem isn’t with today. Maybe it’s with how <strong>distracted, rushed, and stressed</strong> we’ve become.</p>
<p>Maybe the best days aren’t behind us.<br>
<strong>Maybe they’re just waiting to be noticed.</strong></p>
