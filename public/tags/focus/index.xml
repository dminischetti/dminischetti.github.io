      <description>Multitasking is a lie. Discover why single-tasking is the real productivity superpower and how it’s transforming my focus and life.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-multitasking-myth-why-doing-less-makes-you-more-productive"><strong>The Multitasking Myth: Why Doing Less Makes You More Productive</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought I had <strong>cracked the code</strong> to getting things done.</p>
<p>I was a multitasker—<strong>a master of spinning plates.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Answering messages while debugging code.<br>
✔ Cooking dinner while listening to a tech podcast.<br>
✔ Planning my week while pushing a stroller.</p>
<p>I convinced myself this was <strong>peak efficiency</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="turns-out-i-was-dead-wrong"><strong>Turns out, I was dead wrong.</strong></h3>
<p>Multitasking isn’t a productivity hack. It’s <strong>a scam</strong>.</p>
<p>And worse? <strong>It’s been sabotaging my brain for years.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-hidden-cost-of-doing-it-all"><strong>The Hidden Cost of Doing It All</strong></h2>
<p>We live in a world that <strong>worships multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>🖥 Job descriptions praise it.<br>
📈 Productivity gurus preach it.<br>
📱 If you’re not multitasking, you’re “falling behind.”</p>
<p>But science—and <strong>my own experience</strong>—beg to differ.</p>
<p>Multitasking isn’t <strong>actually</strong> doing two things at once.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>rapid task-switching</strong>.</p>
<p>And every time you switch, your brain <strong>pays a price.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jumping between Slack messages and writing code?</strong> You’re not doubling your output—you’re introducing micro-delays that slow you down.</li>
<li><strong>Checking your phone while spending time with family?</strong> You’re mentally buffering between two worlds—never fully present in either.</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to think multitasking kept me <strong>ahead</strong>.</p>
<p>But it was actually the <strong>thing keeping me stuck.</strong></p>
<p>I was <strong>always busy</strong> but never <em>truly</em> productive.</p>
<p>Then, I read something that <strong>hit me like a brick:</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-ability-to-single-task-is-becoming-a-superpower"><strong>“The ability to single-task is becoming a superpower.”</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s when <strong>everything changed.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-heres-what-im-doing-instead"><strong>So Here’s What I’m Doing Instead</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve started embracing <strong>single-tasking</strong> like my productivity depends on it—<strong>because it does.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-time-blocking-20"><strong>1. Time-Blocking 2.0</strong></h3>
<p>I used to schedule my day <strong>down to the minute</strong>.</p>
<p>It only made me <strong>stressed</strong> when things didn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>Now, I align tasks with my <strong>actual energy levels</strong>:<br>
✔ <strong>High-focus work</strong> when my brain is sharp.<br>
✔ <strong>Low-focus tasks</strong> when I’m running on fumes.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>working with my brain, not against it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-digital-decluttering"><strong>2. Digital Decluttering</strong></h3>
<p>I used to think a million open tabs meant <strong>I was working hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>It just meant <strong>I was distracted</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I:<br>
✔ <strong>Close unused tabs.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Write down what I actually need.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Handle tasks <em>one at a time.</em></strong></p>
<p>If something’s <strong>important</strong>, it goes on my <strong>Notion board</strong>.<br>
If it’s not? <strong>It’s gone.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-the-one-tab-rule"><strong>3. The “One-Tab Rule”</strong></h3>
<p>If my brain <strong>wants a second tab</strong>, it means <strong>I need a second task slot later—not now.</strong></p>
<p>This was <strong>tough</strong> as a developer.</p>
<p>I’m used to juggling:<br>
✔ <strong>Documentation</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Stack Overflow threads</strong><br>
✔ <strong>My IDE</strong></p>
<p>But once I stopped, my <strong>focus got sharper.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-thinking-in-depth-not-breadth"><strong>4. Thinking in Depth, Not Breadth</strong></h3>
<p>Instead of <strong>half-absorbing</strong> five articles, I <strong>read one properly</strong>—and actually retain something.</p>
<p>✔ No more <strong>fake productivity.</strong><br>
✔ No more <strong>information overload.</strong></p>
<p>The result?<br>
✔ <strong>Deeper focus.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Lower stress.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Better work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Actually being present in my own life.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve been sold the lie that <strong>multitasking is the key to success.</strong></p>
<p>But what if the real key is <strong>the opposite?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a world where we:<br>
✔ Stop bragging about <strong>being busy</strong>.<br>
✔ Start taking pride in <strong>how well we do one thing at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine how different life would feel.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not perfect at it yet.</p>
<p>I still catch myself <strong>falling back into old habits</strong>:<br>
✔ Checking messages while pushing code.<br>
✔ Wanting to read emails while on a Zoom call.</p>
<p>But now, I <strong>notice it.</strong></p>
<p>I stop.<br>
I refocus.</p>
<p>I’m done with the <strong>chaos.</strong></p>

      <description>Productivity isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing what matters. Discover how to escape the productivity trap and find real progress.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-productivity-trap-why-doing-more-is-keeping-you-stuck"><strong>The Productivity Trap: Why Doing More Is Keeping You Stuck</strong></h1>
<p>For years, I thought <strong>productivity was about doing more.</strong></p>
<p>✔ More tasks.<br>
✔ More efficiency.<br>
✔ More checkboxes.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t constantly <strong>optimizing, planning, and squeezing every second</strong> for maximum output, I was failing.</p>
<p>And at first? <strong>It worked.</strong></p>
<p>I was getting things done. My to-do list was long, and I was checking off items like a machine.</p>
<p>But then something strange happened.</p>
<p>Despite all my so-called <strong>productivity</strong>, I felt like I was going <strong>nowhere.</strong></p>
<p>❌ <strong>Busy, but not fulfilled.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Efficient, but not effective.</strong><br>
❌ <strong>Always working, but never actually moving forward.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s when I realized: <strong>The way we think about productivity is broken.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-false-promise-of-getting-more-done"><strong>The False Promise of “Getting More Done”</strong></h2>
<p>Somewhere along the way, we all bought into a <strong>lie</strong>:</p>
<p>🛑 That the key to success is <strong>efficiency</strong>.<br>
🛑 That if we just optimize our time <strong>perfectly</strong>, automate enough tasks, and use the right tools, we’ll finally get ahead.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-is-not-about-getting-more-things-done-its-about-getting-the"><strong>Productivity is not about getting more things done. It’s about getting the <em>right</em> things done.</strong></h3>
<p>And if you’re not careful, <strong>“being productive” can actually become the biggest distraction from what really matters.</strong></p>
<p>I call it <strong>The Productivity Trap.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-the-productivity-trap-works"><strong>How The Productivity Trap Works</strong></h2>
<p>This is how most people approach work:</p>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>You feel overwhelmed.</strong> Too much to do, not enough time.<br>
2️⃣ <strong>You try to optimize.</strong> Time-blocking, automation, and hacks to squeeze more out of your day.<br>
3️⃣ <strong>You get efficient&hellip; at the wrong things.</strong> Answering emails faster, handling meetings smoother, but none of it actually <em>matters.</em><br>
4️⃣ <strong>You stay stuck in a loop of busyness.</strong> Always “doing,” never really progressing.</p>
<p>This is the scary part:</p>
<h3 id="productivity-can-feel-like-progress-even-when-its-just-motion"><strong>Productivity can feel like progress, even when it’s just motion.</strong></h3>
<p>And that’s exactly how I got stuck for so long.</p>
<p>I was <strong>checking boxes but not moving forward</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>working hard but not working smart</strong>.<br>
I was <strong>busy—but not productive.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-real-secret-to-productivity-subtraction-not-addition"><strong>The Real Secret to Productivity: Subtraction, Not Addition</strong></h2>
<p>I used to ask myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I fit more into my day?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I ask a <strong>better</strong> question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What can I remove?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Real productivity isn’t about <strong>adding</strong> more tasks.</p>
<p>It’s about:<br>
✔ <strong>Eliminating distractions.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Cutting useless work.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Focusing on what actually moves the needle.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how I flipped my mindset:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-stop-optimizing-the-unimportant"><strong>1. Stop Optimizing the Unimportant</strong></h3>
<p>I used to spend <strong>hours</strong> tweaking my task manager, perfecting my schedule, and fine-tuning my workflow.</p>
<p>It felt productive, but in reality? <strong>It was just procrastination in disguise.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does this task even matter?</em></li>
<li><em>Will this move me forward, or just make me feel busy?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, the best way to <strong>be more productive</strong> is to <strong>stop doing half the things you’re doing right now.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-the-8020-focus-shift"><strong>2. The 80/20 Focus Shift</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Pareto Principle</strong> says <strong>80% of results come from 20% of effort.</strong></p>
<p>But most of us spend time on the <strong>80% of tasks</strong> that don’t actually move the needle.</p>
<p>So instead of asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I ask:<br>
✔ <em>What’s the 20% that will make the biggest impact?</em><br>
✔ <em>What can I cut without any real consequence?</em></p>
<p>Then, I <strong>ruthlessly</strong> focus on the <strong>high-impact 20%</strong>—and let go of the rest.</p>
<p>This was a game-changer for me. It’s not about <strong>doing everything</strong>. It’s about doing <strong>the right things.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-single-tasking-the-real-superpower"><strong>3. Single-Tasking: The Real Superpower</strong></h3>
<p>I used to <strong>pride myself on multitasking.</strong></p>
<p>But <strong>multitasking isn’t working faster—it’s working worse.</strong></p>
<p>It’s just rapidly <strong>switching between tasks</strong>, losing focus each time.</p>
<p>Now, I do the opposite:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>One tab at a time.</strong> No distractions.<br>
✔ <strong>One task at a time.</strong> Full focus, deep work.<br>
✔ <strong>One decision at a time.</strong> No jumping back and forth.</p>
<p>It <strong>feels</strong> slower, but in reality? <strong>It’s 10x more effective.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-the-do-less-but-better-rule"><strong>4. The “Do Less, But Better” Rule</strong></h3>
<p>Most people try to do everything <strong>at 70% effort.</strong></p>
<p>They spread themselves too thin, and their work <strong>suffers.</strong></p>
<p>But the real magic happens when you:</p>
<p>✔ Do <strong>fewer</strong> things, but do them <strong>exceptionally well.</strong><br>
✔ Say <strong>no</strong> to everything that doesn’t align with your goals.<br>
✔ Focus on <strong>quality over quantity.</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, by <strong>doing less, you achieve more.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway-stop-measuring-productivity-by-output"><strong>The Takeaway: Stop Measuring Productivity by Output</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest shift I made?</p>
<p>I stopped measuring productivity by <strong>how much I do.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, I measure it by:</p>
<p>✔ <strong>How much progress I make on things that actually matter.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much energy I have left at the end of the day.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>How much freedom I create for myself by removing unnecessary work.</strong></p>
<p>I stopped asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;How can I do more?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And started asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How can I do less, but better?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="if-youre-feeling-stuck-try-this"><strong>If You’re Feeling Stuck, Try This</strong></h2>
<p>If you’ve been <strong>optimizing, planning, and working harder</strong>—but still feel stuck?</p>
<p>Try the <strong>opposite.</strong></p>
<p>✔ Instead of doing more, <strong>do less—strategically.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of working harder, <strong>work on the right things.</strong><br>
✔ Instead of chasing efficiency, <strong>chase clarity.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>the most productive people</strong> aren’t the ones who get the most done.</p>
<p>They’re the ones who <strong>do what matters—and ignore everything else.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the secret.</p>
<p>It’s not about <strong>doing more.</strong><br>
It’s about <strong>doing less—but doing it better.</strong></p>

      <title>How I Outsmart My Own Brain to Get Things Done</title>

      <description>Life feels like an action movie with no pause button. Here&amp;#39;s how I handle the chaos and still get things done.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My brain works like an <strong>action movie with no pause button</strong>. <strong>No clear story, no control</strong>, and just when things start to make sense—BAM! <strong>A sudden cut to something completely different.</strong></p>
<p>One moment, I’m focused, working hard. The next?</p>
<p>Oh wow, <strong>did you know ancient Romans made concrete</strong> that still exists today?<br>
Wait, wasn’t I supposed to answer an email?<br>
Oh, I should set a reminder for that. But which app? Maybe I should try a new one. Let me check&hellip;<br>
Wait. <strong>What was I doing?</strong></p>
<p>And just like that, 30 minutes disappear. I’m holding a coffee I don’t remember making, sitting in front of <strong>a completely different task</strong> than the one I started.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-productivity-toolbox-everything-i-tried-and-why-it-didnt-work"><strong>The Productivity Toolbox: Everything I Tried (and Why It Didn’t Work)</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve tested <strong>every productivity method</strong> I could find.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-it Notes?</strong> Great—until my desk looks like a detective’s crime board.</li>
<li><strong>Timers?</strong> Useful—if I remember I set them.</li>
<li><strong>To-do lists?</strong> I write them, I admire them&hellip; I never check them again.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity apps?</strong> I <strong>collect them like Pokémon.</strong> I have five for tasks, two for time tracking, and one for notes. But guess what? <strong>None work if I forget to open them.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pomodoro?</strong> Nice idea—except I either ignore the timer or focus so much I forget time exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve heard all the usual advice:<br>
<em>&ldquo;Just choose your priorities!&rdquo;</em> But <strong>everything</strong> feels important.<br>
<em>&ldquo;Use reminders!&rdquo;</em> Great idea—if I remember to set them.<br>
<em>&ldquo;Have you tried digital planners?&rdquo;</em> Yes. I lost track of them too.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t try. I do. But <strong>my brain doesn’t follow the rules.</strong></p>
<p>And yet… <strong>I still get things done.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-i-actually-get-work-done"><strong>How I Actually Get Work Done</strong></h2>
<p>I stopped looking for <strong>one perfect system</strong>—because it doesn’t exist. Instead, I use a mix of <strong>simple tricks and mental hacks</strong> to keep myself productive.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One task at a time.</strong> Multitasking? <strong>I quit that.</strong> If I try doing two things at once, I end up finishing <strong>nothing</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Writing everything down.</strong> My memory is unreliable, so I put <strong>everything</strong> in Notion, on sticky notes, in alarms—anywhere my future self might find it.</li>
<li><strong>The Two-Minute Rule.</strong> If something takes <strong>less than two minutes</strong>, I do it <strong>right away</strong>. Otherwise, it disappears into <em>“I’ll do it later”</em> (which means never).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple timers.</strong> Since I forget I set a timer, I use <strong>two or three different ones</strong>. Sometimes, I even ask someone to remind me that I set a timer!</li>
<li><strong>Using my deep focus.</strong> When my brain decides something is <strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK IN THE WORLD</strong>, I just go with it—even if it wasn’t planned.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the most important thing?</p>
<h3 id="i-work-with-my-brain-not-against-it"><strong>I Work With My Brain, Not Against It</strong></h3>
<p>I stopped trying to use <strong>systems made for other people</strong>. I can’t <strong>force</strong> focus, but I can <strong>catch it</strong> when it happens.</p>
<p>If I suddenly get <strong>super focused</strong> on a task, I don’t stop. If my brain jumps between ideas, I <strong>write them all down</strong> and organize them later.</p>
<p>My productivity is not <strong>straightforward</strong>. <strong>It moves in all directions.</strong> And that’s okay.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-tools-that-sometimes-help"><strong>The Tools That (Sometimes) Help</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notion:</strong> My digital brain dump. If I don’t remember where I wrote something, it’s probably in Notion.</li>
<li><strong>Post-it Notes:</strong> Old-school but effective. I put them on my desk, my monitor, my wallet—everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Timers (Lots of Them):</strong> On my phone, laptop, and smartwatch. <em>At least one might help me.</em></li>
<li><strong>Single-tasking mode:</strong> <strong>One window. One tab. One job.</strong> If I open a second tab, it means <strong>I need to do it later.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Solid Starts:</strong> Yes, even for feeding my son. Because <strong>focus problems don’t take a break</strong> when you’re a parent.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-takeaway"><strong>The Takeaway</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, my brain is <strong>chaotic</strong>. Yes, I sometimes open a new tab and forget why. Yes, I have <strong>a small collection of abandoned productivity tools</strong>.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day? <strong>I get things done.</strong></p>
<p>Not in a straight line. Not in a perfect way. But in <strong>my way.</strong></p>
<p>Because sometimes, <strong>thinking differently is what helps you find better solutions.</strong></p>
<p>So if you ever see me <strong>staring at the screen</strong>, just know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I might be solving a <strong>complicated problem</strong>&hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip;or I might have forgotten what I was doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, <strong>I’ll figure it out.</strong></p>
