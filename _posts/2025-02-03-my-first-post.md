You fix a bug. The code works. The ticket is closed.

Two weeks later—another bug. Different, but suspiciously familiar.

That’s when you realize: you didn’t fix the problem, just its symptoms.
One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned as a Backend Developer at BLOX Digital is that debugging isn’t about putting out fires—it’s about fireproofing the system.

Recently, I worked on an issue where analytics data wasn’t showing up correctly. At first glance, it looked like a simple missing piece of data. But digging deeper, I realized it wasn’t a one-off glitch—it was a systemic inconsistency in how reporting data was handled across different environments.

A quick fix could have made the issue disappear for now, but real engineering means thinking long-term. Instead, I worked on making the reporting pipeline more resilient, ensuring more reliable data across the board.

This experience reinforced a few key truths about great engineering:
-          Fixing a bug isn’t the goal—preventing it from reoccurring is.
-          A single bug can reveal weak points in the system—if you know where to look.
-         The best companies, like BLOX Digital, value developers who think beyond the ticket and improve the foundation.

It also reminded me of a great insight from The Pragmatic Programmer:
“Fix the problem, not the blame. Sometimes the problem lies not with the code, but with the process.”
